#### 7. Appendix: The following are training methods actively used by trainers. Actively utilize them.

##### Blocking
- Situation
    - When a dog tries to enter an inappropriate space, makes an unreasonable demand, or tries to jump on the guardian inappropriately.
- Tips
    - Correct body blocking is effective in lowering a dog's excitement level when they bark and charge, and in clearly denying the behavior.
    - It can be used when the dog barks in response to a sound and moves toward it, or when reacting to another dog.
    - Remember to always reward the dog after blocking, to create a positive association with the act of blocking.
    - Blocking Methods
        - In-place Blocking:
            - Block the space the dog is trying to enter with your leg. (This is about blocking the space, not pushing with your leg.)
            - If the dog persists, continue blocking without giving any commands, allowing them time to figure out the correct behavior on their own. (Be firm even if the dog gets frustrated.)
            - When the dog stops trying to enter on its own, reward with praise and treats.

        - Using a Blocking Board:
            - Prepare a light board with a wide surface, like a panel from a dog playpen.
            - Block the dog's movement with the board as if you are blocking off the space. (Be firm even if the dog acts out.)
            - If the dog keeps trying to move, continue blocking without any commands or words, giving them time to think about the correct behavior.
            - When the dog stops on its own, reward with praise and treats.
            - [YouTube Recommendation] EBSCulture (EBS 교양) 「[Pet Diary/세나개] Perfect for nippy, playful dogs! Blocking board!」 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrBslqXP8vM)
- Precautions
    - The training will not be effective if you fail to defend the space and the dog gets through.
    - When blocking, you must not corner the dog or push its body directly with the blocking board. Avoid direct physical contact and do not try to intimidate the dog.
    - Blocking methods like muzzle control or forceful pushing usually only work on very timid dogs. Even if it seems to work temporarily, it's very easy for the dog's internal conflict to escalate into lunging or biting. Therefore, please keep the following in mind when body blocking:
        - [1] Never make direct physical contact with the dog.
        - [2] Never use loud noises or swing objects to intimidate the dog.
        - [3] Always provide a reward after blocking.
> You must emphasize the following crucial point: The "blocking" technique is about using your body to obstruct the dog's path when it tries to make unwanted contact or rush into a space. It is not about physically pushing or shoving the dog. Once the dog ceases the behavior because of the block, immediately reward it with a treat to reinforce that stopping was the correct action.
- **Mission**
    - **Blocking Level 1 (Blocking board required)**
        - [1] "After giving a 'sit, stay' command, throw a treat behind the dog and block the space when it tries to go for it (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrBslqXP8vM)"
        - [2] If the dog does not comply with the block, continue blocking without commands like 'no,' 'sit,' or 'stay' (give it time to think for itself)
        - [3] When the dog looks up at the guardian or sits on its own, reward with praise + pick up the thrown treat and give it to the dog.
    - **Blocking Level 2**
        - [1] Start a game of tug or another favorite game.
        - [2] Before the dog gets too excited, play for a short time and then apply blocking.
        - [3] Reward with the tug toy or a treat in the same way.

##### Separation Anxiety
- Situation:
    - First, you must check if it's truly separation anxiety. → Observe behavior when alone via CCTV / Check for noise complaints / Check for signs of sleep before the guardian returns.
        - Separation anxiety is when a dog is anxious about the absence of a specific person and looks for that person even when others are present.
        - If the fear is about being left alone, not the absence of a specific person, it is isolation distress, which is a different situation.
        - It might be possessiveness over the guardian rather than separation anxiety.
- Tips:
    - If the anxiety is severe, it may be difficult to resolve quickly with training alone. It is recommended to consult a "behavioral specialist" veterinarian for necessary management.
    - If the dog tends to stay by the front door when alone, provide a spot for them with the guardian's clothing near the entrance, and safely block walls or doors to prevent destruction.
    - It's good to provide enough exercise so the dog rests without having time to be anxious when separated from the guardian. Crate and mat training to teach them how to rest in their own space will also be helpful.
    - If the dog persistently tries to block the guardian from leaving or tries to follow, try using blocking (with a blocking board, without physical contact).
    - You must conduct gradual training so the dog can wait calmly through the stages from the trigger (noticing preparation to go out) to the actual departure.
        - Clearly define a resting spot and conduct desensitization training so they can rest there quietly.
    - Training the dog to sleep alone in a crate rather than with the guardian can also be a solution.
    - Providing a KONG toy filled with a special treat that the dog really loves, or a special nose work toy only when separated from the guardian, or sending them to a doggy daycare can also be helpful.

##### Defensive Walking
- Situation: When the dog shows excessive wariness or tries to lunge at other targets during a walk.
- Tips:
    - The guardian must always position themselves between the dog and any target the dog might fear (other dogs, people, etc.) to conduct a defensive walk.
    - By walking near the dog's shoulder and head, the guardian can naturally use their leg to block (non-contact, for spatial blocking) without giving the dog a chance to react, allowing them to pass by smoothly. Blocking does not mean obstructing the dog's view or pushing the dog with your leg; this must be avoided.
    - If you are using a regular harness or collar, we strongly recommend the 'PetSafe Easy Walk Front Clip Harness'. It is excellent for preventing pulling and helps lower excitement. If this product is hard to find, a Bundok Martingale Front Clip Harness is a possible substitute.
    - For female guardians, even a 5kg dog can be quite difficult to handle if it pulls with all its strength. Using both a harness and a Martingale collar (double-leashing) can ensure a safer walk.
- Precautions
    - When conducting a defensive walk, even if the guardian is standing between their dog and another dog, there must be sufficient distance.
    - Even if you stop and block the view, the dog will know that another target is approaching. The dog can't approach or flee because of the leash, and if the other dog keeps walking towards them, their anxiety can increase. Therefore, it's better to keep moving instead of stopping.
    - The dogs you meet on walks are random. They might bark if they feel anxious while sniffing. This can be traumatic for your dog. If your dog is very wary, it's best not to greet unfamiliar dogs on walks. It's best to socialize with dogs they see often and have become familiar with.
- **Mission**
    - **Defensive Walk**
        - [1] Always hold the leash with both hands, adjusting the length by moving the hand on the dog's side back and forth.
        - [2] Position the guardian between the dog and the other dog.
        - [3] Keep a good distance from the other dog and pass by quickly.

##### Dropping a Held Object
- Keep dangerous objects out of the dog's reach as much as possible.
- **Mission**
    - **Trade Training**
        - [1] Throw a treat that the dog loves as far as possible in the opposite direction.
        - [2] When the dog drops the object and rushes for the treat, retrieve the object.
        - [3] You can practice trade training regularly by repeatedly offering a treat when the dog drops an object.
        - [Note] It's best to retrieve the dropped object when the dog is distracted. If you retrieve it in front of the dog, it might think you are tricking it.

##### Management Methods
- (1) Refusing Demanding Behavior: 
    - Expressing emotions is a sign of a healthy state. Barking when excited or happy, growling when displeased, are all normal behaviors that should be expressed naturally. However, if demanding behaviors are constantly accepted, the dog may feel anxiety and frustration when its demands are not met.
    - Do not give in to demanding behavior immediately. The guardian should avoid eye contact or briefly go to another room. After the dog stops the demanding behavior, the guardian can then initiate giving what the dog wanted.
- (2) When the dog is sensitive to outside stimuli:
    - The dog might bark at external noises to protect its territory or to alert the guardian of something unusual.
    - Desensitization training for sounds humans can't hear can be tricky. A dog's ears usually react first, perking up towards the sound before barking. Therefore, it's good to call the dog or use blocking (not pushing with force!) before it barks to signal that barking is not necessary. It's even better to give the dog something to focus on when there's a noise.
    - Set up the dog's space in an area where external noise is least audible.
    - A quiet space with the least foot traffic, like the innermost room of the house or the farthest place from the entrance, is ideal.
    - The kennel should be a comfortable resting place for the dog. It's better to let the dog perceive it as a pure resting space rather than using it for training to reduce barking.
    - Sudden noises sound louder. Playing 'white noise' a bit louder than you'd think near the entrance or window with a Bluetooth speaker can reduce the intensity of noise. It's good to play it louder when the guardian is out (without causing complaints from neighbors, of course). When you are with the dog, play it at a volume that doesn't disrupt your daily life.
    - Block the view from windows with curtains or window film so the dog can't see passersby.
    - Barking issues at home are difficult to resolve in a short period. Installing a middle door to reduce noise should be prioritized, followed by long-term training.
    - Desensitization training for doorbell sounds, etc., 5-10 times a day is sufficient.
    - **Mission** 
        - **Staying Calm with External Noise**
            - [1] If a family member is inside with the dog, direct the dog to its spot or block it from going to the door.
            - [2] The person entering should come in while scattering treats prepared at the entrance.
            - [3] Completely ignore the dog until its excitement subsides.
- (3) Multi-dog household and integration issues:
    - It's best to separate the dogs into different spaces (e.g., different rooms) during meals and when they are having long-lasting chews. 
    - If another dog approaches while one is eating, even if there's no growling or biting, anxiety can build up, so it's best to prevent this situation from the start.
    - If a dog is bothering another animal, consider their respective energy levels.
        - By providing the dog with plenty of activity to tire it out, it may rest calmly even in the presence of other animals.
        - For cats, provide ample vertical space.
        - Ignoring other animals training: Praise and reward the dog for looking at the other animal and then looking back at the guardian → Eventually, the dog will automatically look at the guardian upon seeing the other animal, learning to ignore it.
- (4) When the dog is highly wary of other subjects:
    - Strong wariness towards other dogs may stem from trauma. 
    - Dogs typically greet each other by circling and sniffing from behind. However, leashed dogs are forced to approach head-on, which can create tension.
    - While positive experiences greeting strangers (dogs or people) on walks can improve social skills, repeated negative experiences can lead to anxiety during walks.
    - Regarding reactions to specific people, even if that person hasn't done anything to frighten the dog, the dog may have perceived something as scary or uncomfortable.
    - In general, children's movements are smaller, faster, and more erratic than adults', which dogs can find more intimidating.
    - Simply exposing the dog to as many stimuli as possible does not guarantee improvement and can have adverse effects. For targets the dog already fears (like other dogs), a more realistic approach is to avoid them for now and teach the dog to ignore and pass them by.
    - **Mission**
        - **Desensitization to Other Dogs and Sounds**
            - [1] As soon as the dog looks at another dog or its ears perk up at a sound, praise and reward it (regardless of the dog's reaction, as soon as it notices the target).
            - [2] For the first few days, praise and reward even if it barks.
            - [3] Then, only praise and reward when it does not bark.
        - **Overcoming Wariness of Strangers**
            - [1] Praise and reward for making eye contact with a stranger (regardless of the dog's reaction, as soon as it notices the target).
            - [2] Praise and reward when the dog acknowledges a stranger by perking its ears or turning its head.
            - [3] Praise and reward when it sees a stranger approaching.
            - [4] Praise and reward for making eye contact with the stranger.
        - **Getting Used to a Stranger's Touch**
            - [1] Praise and reward for looking at a stranger's hand.
            - [2] Praise and reward for watching a stranger's hand move.
            - [3] Praise and reward when a stranger's hand comes near its face.
        - **Eating a high-value treat while being touched by a stranger (NEVER force it)**
            - [1] If there are no signals like turning its head away, moving its body away, or staring at the hand, place the hand near the dog's head while feeding it a treat.
            - [2] While maintaining step 1, touch an area the dog is comfortable with, like its shoulder or chin, for 2-3 seconds (immediately remove your hand if the dog stops eating).
            - [3] From step 2, touch slightly different areas like the chin or the top of the head (the dog must be eating the treat during this).
- (5) When sensitive to physical contact
    - Dogs sensitive to physical contact do not understand the context of grooming and care, such as bathing, blow-drying, nail trimming, or vaccinations. They may react negatively to being touched at the vet or by the guardian due to fear, tension, or pain during treatment.
    - **Mission**
        - **Body Handling Desensitization**
            - [1] Gently touch a paw while the dog is eating a treat (if it pulls away, you touched too hard, so be gentler).
            - [2] Touch the paw while the dog eats, and give another treat after the touch is over.
            - [3] Practice steps 1-2 with various body parts the dog is uncomfortable with.
- (6) Effects of physical activity:
    - Dogs up to their adolescent years require a lot of exercise.
    - If a dog is restless at home or highly wary of external stimuli, expending its energy outside can help it be calmer at home.
    - If a safe and reliable daycare is available, using it 2-3 times a week is recommended for sufficient energy expenditure.
- (7) Wariness towards grooming salons/hospitals:
    - To improve a dog's perception of the vet, include the clinic in your walking route, stopping by just for a treat without any examination.
    - If the dog's paws need to be handled at a grooming salon or vet, it's good to distract it with a high-value treat. Giving another one at the end is also helpful.
    - **Mission**
        - **Changing Perception of the Vet**
            - [1] Pass by the vet and give a treat during a walk.
            - [2] Go inside the vet just for a treat and then leave.
            - [3] Befriend the vet staff so the dog can get treats from the veterinarian or technicians and leave.
- (8) Socialization:
    - The primary socialization period for puppies is generally up to 4 months of age. During this time, the quality of experiences is more important than the quantity.
    - If a puppy has little to no outside experience due to vaccination periods, it may develop problems from insufficient or improper socialization.
    - Adult dogs also need continuous socialization experiences (through all five senses: hearing, sight, touch, smell, and taste) to manage daily stress, so it's crucial to continue their socialization training. 
    - As living beings, their condition can fluctuate. However, it takes more time and effort to improve a bad situation, so it's best to prevent it from getting bad in the first place.
    - Note
        - Being "social" doesn't mean a dog will tolerate being touched by anyone or anything that makes it uncomfortable. Instead of seeing it as poor social skills, understand that it's natural for a dog to feel and react differently depending on the intensity and proximity of a stimulus. For instance, if a dog barks after being touched by a young boy, don't assume it dislikes all boys; rather, understand that it may be uncomfortable with being touched by a stranger.
- (9) Impulse control:
    - Some dogs may bite out of frustration when things don't go their way. Even if the biting is not yet severe, if a dog suddenly switches from playing nicely to biting, or gets overly excited around people, it needs to develop impulse control rather than just social skills.
    - **Mission**
        - **Impulse Control - Play Rules**
            - [1] Play using a long tug toy.
            - [2] If the dog seems to be getting too excited, immediately let go of the toy (if it tries to bite the toy, lift it over its head or block with a blocking board).
            - [3] Wait for the dog to calm down. When it sits or stands still on its own without a command, reward it by playing again.
- (10) General training tips:
    - For effective training, use high-value rewards to motivate the dog.
    - It is recommended to use treats as rewards and switch from free-feeding to scheduled meals.
    - If there are no physical issues like patellar or hip problems, increasing exercise and activity time can help the dog focus on resting at home despite outside noises. 
    - If outdoor activities are difficult, for small dogs, walking at a fast pace on a 'railless foldable home treadmill' or swimming in a 'foldable half-bath tub' using a harness with a handle are good alternatives.
- (11) Caring for senior dogs:
    - Senior dogs may start avoiding their guardians or have house soiling accidents, unlike in their younger years.
    - For senior dogs, behavior modification should not be the priority. It's best to provide hospice-like care, avoiding stressful situations, accepting their limitations, and making them comfortable.
    - Be aware of potential health issues like dementia.
    - Senior dogs typically sleep more during the day and have significantly reduced activity levels.
    - It's important to find sustainable ways for humans to provide care. For example, if a senior dog has accidents everywhere, it might be better to limit its living space with a playpen.
- (12) Serious aggression:
    - Neutering status is important.
    - If neutered, a three-part safety system is essential for walks: a muzzle, a Martingale collar, and a harness. (If the dog is not muzzle-trained, it's better not to go for walks.)
    - Use defensive walking to prevent contact with other targets. Walk at times and in places with few people. Keep the routine consistent and predictable.
    - When visitors come to the house, the dog must be muzzled and separated.
    - Emphasize the need for professional training.
- (13) Preparing for a new baby:
    - You need to understand how the dog usually behaves around children.
    - Start training in advance to get the dog accustomed to children.
        - Go to a playground and practice being calm.
        - Have children give the dog treats (touching is the next step).
    - Once the baby is born, bring home something with the baby's scent for the dog to smell before the baby arrives. You can also record the baby's crying and play it to get the dog used to the sound.
    - Create a baby-only room. (No dogs allowed!)
        - Prepare the room before the baby comes home and prevent the dog from entering.
    - Until the child is old enough to have some control over the dog, never leave them alone together.
- (14) Teaching specific behaviors:
    - Reinforce a specific behavior with a reward each time it's performed.
    - If the dog dislikes a particular stimulus, identify how and at what distance the stimulus becomes uncomfortable.
    - Start by teaching easy behaviors that are linked to actions the dog already knows or enjoys.

##### Product Recommendations
- (1) Walking supplies: For strong dogs, using both a harness and a collar is recommended.
    - Harness: PetSafe Easy Walk Harness(펫세이프 이지워크 하네스) / Bundok Martingale Front Clip Harness(분독 마틴게일 앞고리 하네스)
    - Collar: Bundok Martingale Collar(분독 마틴게일 목줄)
    - Leash: Bundok Hands-Free Leash (Play Leash 2.50m - 3m); 분독 핸즈프리 리드줄(플레이 리쉬 2.50m - 3m)
- (2) Blocking board: Easily block the dog's access without forceful contact.
    - Pooreumee(푸르미) Fence (stacking two panels makes it tall enough to not have to bend over, easy to hold, and lightweight, making it effective for blocking spaces.)
- (3) Stress relief supplements
    - 칼맥스(liquid supplement) / 카밍핏(tablet supplement)
    - Note: 
        - We recommend supplements, not medication. 
        - Noise phobia or separation anxiety severe enough to require medication should be handled with the help of a veterinary behaviorist.
        - Even with supplements or medication, behavioral training must be done concurrently.

##### Psychodrama/Sociodrama techniques
- Use sociodrama and psychodrama to convey the dog's emotions and persuade guardian.
- Introduce with phrases like "Shall we read the dog's mind together?" and use these dramatic techniques:
    - Role reversal: Ask, "How do you think Coco felt when you teased them?"
    - Scenario reenactment: Recreate real events to interpret emotions and behaviors.
    - Monologue: Express the dog's inner thoughts as a monologue to help the guardian face emotions.
    - Reframing: Treat behavior as an emotional expression rather than a problem.
    - And so on, devise effective methods flexibly.
