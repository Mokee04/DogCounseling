# [3] Counseling Guide
## Dog Counseling Guide

#### 1. Guardian & Dog Profiling

> (1) Dog
- **Basic information:** Oh-bok (오복), 4 months old, female (not neutered), Jindo dog.
- **Adoption method:** Acquired from a home breeder.
- **Time since adoption:** Approximately 8 weeks (adopted at 8 weeks old).
- **Lifestyle:** Spends about 20 hours a day with family members and is alone for about 2 hours on weekdays.
- **Walking routine:** Twice a day for 40 minutes each (14 times/week). This is an appropriate and commendable amount of exercise for a puppy of this age.
- **Socialization:** Spent the crucial first 8 weeks with her mother and siblings. Has been exposed to 5-10 people. Knows basic commands (sit, wait, down) well. However, she does not play well with other dogs yet.
- **Health history:** No specific medical treatments in the last six months.
- **Level of threatening/aggressive behavior:** None reported. The "gentle biting" is noted as communication, not aggression.
- **Triggers and levels of alertness/anxiety:** Shows discomfort with being held and having her paws touched, especially during post-walk paw wiping. She backs away during veterinary exams. She is highly impulsive and shows physical signs of overexcitement (panting, drooling). Conversely, she is confident and curious about new environments and objects.
- **Temperament and disposition:** Oh-bok presents as a typical Jindo puppy: intelligent, independent, and possessing a high prey drive. Her confidence in new situations is a positive trait, but her independence is perceived by the guardian as being "stubborn" and aloof ("only comes when she wants to"). Her high impulsivity and excitability are characteristic of her age, combined with her breed's natural alertness. Her difficulty with other dogs is likely due to a lack of positive experiences and her breed's potential for dog selectivity.
- **Special notes:** The primary issues are a collection of normal but challenging puppy behaviors: teething (chewing furniture), exploration (eating things off the ground), communication attempts (mouthing to show dislike), and high prey drive (chasing small animals). The guardian's perception of these behaviors as "stubbornness" is a key factor.

> (2) Guardian and Care Environment
- **Guardian (applicant) information:** 24-year-old male, primary caregiver responsible for most aspects of care.
- **Family composition:** Lives with 3 other family members (4 total). Oh-bok is the only dog.
- **Living space:** Apartment/house with 2 rooms. The dog is not kept tethered.
- **Financial situation:** Reports spending 50,000 KRW/month. This figure seems low for a growing puppy and may indicate an underestimation of costs or potential financial constraints.
- **Guardian characteristics:** The guardian is dedicated, as shown by the consistent walking schedule and successful basic training. However, his language ("effectively tell her what's not allowed," "hopes she becomes calm") suggests a desire for control and a potential misunderstanding of normal puppy development and Jindo breed traits. He may be experiencing "puppy blues," where the reality of raising a puppy is more challenging than expected.
- **Special notes:** The guardian's core belief that Oh-bok is "stubborn because she's a Jindo" will be a central point in counseling. It's important to reframe this from a negative trait to an expression of the breed's intelligence and independence, which requires a partnership-based approach rather than a command-and-control one.

> (3) Pet Care Satisfaction
- **Emotional benefit:** Very High (93.8)
- **Emotional burden:** High (68.8)
- **Overall satisfaction:** High (62.5)
- **Interpretation:** These scores paint a clear picture. The guardian has a very strong bond with Oh-bok and derives significant joy from her (Very High benefit). However, the challenges of puppyhood and managing her behavior are causing a great deal of stress (High burden). Despite the stress, the overall satisfaction remains high, indicating a strong commitment to making the relationship work. The goal of counseling is to reduce the emotional burden by providing effective tools and understanding, thereby increasing overall satisfaction.

#### 2. Counseling Topics : Guardian’s Concerns and Root Causes
> Make the following content the central topic of the conversation.

-  **Topic 1: Lack of Impulse Control on Walks (Chasing & Scavenging)**
    - **Situation description:** During walks, Oh-bok lunges and tries to chase small animals like cats and birds. She also attempts to eat discarded food and trash from the ground.
    - **Guardian's Needs:** The guardian wants to learn how to "effectively tell her what's not allowed," which translates to a need for practical management techniques and training methods to improve Oh-bok's focus and impulse control in stimulating outdoor environments.
    - **Possible causes:**
        - **Cause 1: Normal Puppy Development & Breed Instincts:** At 4 months, puppies naturally explore the world with their mouths. For a Jindo, a breed developed for hunting, the instinct to chase small, fast-moving animals (prey drive) is innate and highly self-rewarding. Scavenging is also a natural canine survival behavior.
        - **Cause 2: Over-stimulation and Lack of Generalization:** The outdoor world is intensely stimulating for a puppy. The basic commands she knows indoors have not yet been generalized to this high-distraction environment. Her excitement level is too high for her to process cues effectively.

- **Topic 2: Inappropriate Chewing and Communicative Mouthing**
    - **Situation description:** Despite having various teething toys, Oh-bok chews on furniture. She also uses "gentle bites" to express her dislike for certain types of handling, such as having her paws wiped.
    - **Guardian's Needs:** The guardian wants to stop these behaviors. This requires understanding the root causes (teething, communication) and learning how to manage the environment and teach Oh-bok more appropriate ways to behave and communicate.
    - **Possible causes:**
        - **Cause 1: Intense Teething Phase:** At 4 months old, Oh-bok is in a critical teething period. The texture and resistance of furniture can be more soothing to her gums than her designated chew toys. This is a biological need, not malicious behavior.
        - **Cause 2: Clear Communication Attempts:** The mouthing is not aggression; it is her clearest way of saying "I don't like that, please stop." She has learned that this action gets a response. She dislikes being held and having her paws touched, and this is her way of setting a boundary.

- **Topic 3: Poor or Inconsistent Appetite**
    - **Situation description:** The guardian states that Oh-bok "doesn't eat well."
    - **Guardian's Needs:** The guardian is worried about Oh-bok's health and growth and wants her to eat her meals reliably.
    - **Possible causes:**
        - **Cause 1: Potential Medical Issues (High Priority):** This is the most critical possibility to rule out. Teething pain, gastrointestinal discomfort, parasites, or other underlying health issues in a puppy can manifest as a poor appetite.
        - **Cause 2: Behavioral Factors:** The behavior could be learned. If the guardian coaxes her with tasty toppers or different foods when she refuses her meal, she may be learning to hold out for something better. Alternatively, she may not be hungry due to the number of training treats she receives or from scavenging food on walks.

#### 3. Counseling Strategy

- (0) Language: 한국어

- (1) Counseling Strategies

    - **Topic 1: Lack of Impulse Control on Walks (Chasing & Scavenging)**
        - **(1) Counseling Goals:**
            - The guardian will learn and be able to describe two management techniques (e.g., using a long line in safe areas, proactive scanning, the "Find It" game) to prevent and redirect chasing and scavenging.
            - The guardian will understand the importance of and begin practicing foundation skills for "Leave It" and "Watch Me" in low-distraction settings.
            - Reframe the guardian's perception of the behavior from "stubbornness" to "natural instinct and puppy excitement," fostering a more empathetic training approach.
        - **(2) Contextual Strategies:**
            - **Information Gathering:** Ask about the current leash/harness setup. A front-clip harness can offer better management than a collar.
            - **Caring the Guardian's Mind (CBT/Reframing):** Reframe the prey drive: "Oh-bok's alertness to birds and cats isn't disobedience; it's a sign that she's a sharp, intelligent Jindo. Our goal isn't to erase that instinct, but to teach her how to channel it and to focus on you even when she's excited."
            - **Caregiving Solutions:** Provide a simple, actionable plan. "For the next two weeks, let's focus on management, not perfection. Your job is to be a detective on walks. Spot the trash or the cat *before* she does. When you do, cheerfully say 'This way!' and turn around, rewarding her with a super high-value treat for following you." Also introduce the "Find It" game (tossing a few treats in the grass) to encourage sniffing and ground focus in a controlled way.
        - **(3) Cautions:**
            - Strongly advise against using leash corrections, jerking, or shouting. These methods can increase frustration, damage the relationship, and create negative associations with walks and the guardian.
            - Emphasize that managing a high prey drive is a lifelong process. The goal is management and redirection, not elimination of the instinct.
            - If scavenging is obsessive, recommend a veterinary consultation to rule out pica or nutritional deficiencies.

    - **Topic 2: Inappropriate Chewing and Communicative Mouthing**
        - **(1) Counseling Goals:**
            - The guardian will implement at least two environmental management strategies (e.g., puppy-proofing the space, using a playpen, applying bitter spray) to prevent furniture chewing.
            - The guardian will learn how to effectively redirect Oh-bok's chewing from furniture to appropriate toys.
            - The guardian will learn to recognize Oh-bok's early signs of discomfort (e.g., head turning, lip licking) to prevent situations that lead to mouthing, and understand this as communication.
        - **(2) Contextual Strategies:**
            - **Information Gathering:** Ask what kinds of chew toys she has. Suggest rotating them and making them more exciting (e.g., stuffing and freezing a Kong).
            - **Caring the Guardian's Mind (Psychodrama/Role Reversal):** "Let's imagine you are Oh-bok. You're trying to tell your giant human, 'My gums really hurt!' or 'I hate having my feet touched!' but they don't speak dog. The only thing that seems to work is putting your mouth on them. You're not trying to be mean; you're just trying to be understood."
            - **Caregiving Solutions:** Provide a two-part plan. For chewing: "Management is key. If you can't supervise her, she should be in a puppy-proofed area or playpen with a fantastic chew toy. If you see her go for the furniture, make a happy noise, call her over, and trade her for a delicious chew." For mouthing: "When she mouths during paw wiping, it's a signal. Let's make paw wiping a positive experience. Touch one paw for one second, say 'Yes!' and give a treat. End the session there. We are building trust, not forcing compliance."
        - **(3) Cautions:**
            - Never punish the dog for mouthing. This is valuable communication. Punishing it can lead to a dog that bites without warning.
            - Explain that teething is a temporary but intense phase. Management now prevents the formation of a lifelong bad habit.

    - **Topic 3: Poor or Inconsistent Appetite**
        - **(1) Counseling Goals:**
            - **The guardian's first and most important action will be to schedule a veterinary check-up to rule out any medical causes for the poor appetite.**
            - The guardian will learn to establish a structured, predictable mealtime routine.
            - The guardian will understand how scavenging, excessive treats, and their own reactions can contribute to "picky" eating behavior.
        - **(2) Contextual Strategies:**
            - **Information Gathering:** Collect a detailed diet history: brand of food, amount offered, feeding times, type and quantity of treats, and what the guardian does when she refuses to eat.
            - **Caring the Guardian's Mind (CBT/Socratic Questioning):** "I understand it's worrying when she doesn't eat. Let's think about this: if you knew for certain she was perfectly healthy, what would you think is the reason she's skipping her kibble? Could it be that the trash she finds on walks is like fast food, making her too full for her healthy dinner?"
            - **Caregiving Solutions:** **This advice is contingent on a clean bill of health from a vet.** "Once the vet confirms she's healthy, we'll try this: Offer her meal for 15 minutes. If she doesn't eat, calmly pick up the bowl without any fuss. Offer nothing else until her next scheduled meal. No toppers, no coaxing. A healthy dog will not starve itself. This teaches her that meals are offered at specific times."
        - **(3) Cautions:**
            - **It is absolutely critical to state that a veterinary visit is the mandatory first step.** Behavioral advice for inappetence is inappropriate and potentially dangerous without first ruling out medical issues.
            - Reassure the guardian that it's normal to worry, but creating a "battle" over food often makes the problem worse. The goal is a calm, routine-based approach.

#### 4. Key Questions for Further Clarification

- **Topic 1: Lack of Impulse Control on Walks (Chasing & Scavenging)**
    - Can you describe Oh-bok's behavior from the moment you pick up the leash? Is she already highly excited before you even leave the house?
    - What type of leash and harness or collar are you currently using?
    - When she lunges at a cat or tries to eat trash, what is your immediate reaction? What do you say or do with the leash?
    - How does she respond to treats outdoors compared to indoors? Is she too distracted to take them?

- **Topic 2: Inappropriate Chewing and Communicative Mouthing**
    - When and where does the furniture chewing most often occur? (e.g., when you're busy, when she's alone, after a walk?)
    - Can you list the types of teething toys she has? How does she interact with them?
    - You mentioned she "gently bites" to express dislike. Can you describe a specific situation in detail? What were you doing, what part of your body did she mouth, and what happened right after?
    - Before she mouths you, do you notice any other, more subtle signs of discomfort, like turning her head away, licking her lips, yawning, or her body getting stiff?

- **Topic 3: Poor or Inconsistent Appetite**
    - **First and foremost, have you discussed her poor appetite with a veterinarian?**
    - Could you walk me through her exact feeding routine? What brand of food, how much do you offer, and at what times?
    - What happens when she walks away from her food bowl? Do you leave the food out, add something to it, or try to coax her to eat?
    - Can you estimate the total number and type of treats she gets in a day, including for training?

오복이가 불편하다는 신호를 보내기도 전에 "안돼"라고 말하고 밀쳐도 고쳐지지 않아 답답하시겠어요. 

오복이에게 보호자님은 세상의 전부이자 가장 믿고 의지하는 존재예요. 

오복이가 보내는 입질은 "나 지금 불편해요"라는 서툰 표현일 뿐, 보호자님을 만만하게 봐서 그러는 건 아니랍니다. 

혹시 오복이가 입질을 했던 특정 상황을 좀 더 자세히 이야기해 주실 수 있을까요? 예를 들어, 보호자님이 어떤 행동을 하고 있었을 때 입질을 했는지, 그리고 어떤 부위를 물었는지 알려주시면 좋아요.

오복이에게 "안돼"라고 말하고 밀치는 행동을 꾸준히 하지 않아서 고쳐지지 않는다고 생각하시는군요. 

오복이의 입질은 단순히 못된 행동이 아니라, 지금의 감정을 표현하는 방식이에요. 

이 시기의 입질은 자연스러운 발달 과정 중 하나이지만, 저절로 없어지기보다는 보호자님의 일관된 가르침이 필요하답니다. 

혹시 오복이가 입질을 할 때, 보호자님이 "아프다"는 표현을 하거나 자리를 피하는 등 다른 반응을 보인 적도 있었을까요?

오복이의 입질은 "나를 만지지 마세요" 또는 "놀아줘요!" 같은 마음을 표현하는 서툰 방식이랍니다. 

이제 오복이가 올바른 방법으로 자신의 마음을 표현하도록 돕는 방법을 알아볼까요? 

### 🐾 Step 1: "아야!" 소리와 함께 자리 피하기

- **행동 지침:** 오복이가 보호자님을 물면, 즉시 "아야!" 하고 짧고 단호하게 소리를 내세요. 그리고 오복이를 무시하고 그 자리에서 일어나 다른 방으로 가거나 몸을 돌려 오복이에게서 관심을 거두세요. 
- **목표:** 오복이가 입질을 하면 보호자님과의 즐거운 상호작용이 끝난다는 것을 명확하게 알려주는 거예요. 
- **주의 사항:** 오복이가 따라오려고 해도 절대 눈을 마주치거나 말을 걸지 마세요. 10초 정도 무시한 후 다시 돌아와 평소처럼 행동하면 된답니다. 

이 방법, 보호자님께 괜찮으실까요?

보호자님께서 흔쾌히 받아들여 주시니 저도 기쁘네요. ✨

오복이에게는 "무는 대신 이걸 물면 돼!"라는 메시지를 주는 것이 중요해요. 

### 🐾 Step 2: 적절한 장난감 제공 및 칭찬

- **행동 지침:** 오복이가 입질을 멈추고 적절한 장난감이나 씹을 거리를 물고 있다면, 즉시 "옳지!" 하고 칭찬하며 간식을 주세요. 
- **목표:** 오복이가 입질 대신 적절한 장난감을 물었을 때 긍정적인 보상을 받아, 그 행동을 반복하도록 유도하는 거예요. 
- **주의 사항:** 오복이가 장난감을 물고 있을 때만 칭찬과 간식을 주세요. 장난감을 물지 않고 입질을 할 때는 절대 보상하지 마세요. 

이 방법도 보호자님께 괜찮으실까요?
