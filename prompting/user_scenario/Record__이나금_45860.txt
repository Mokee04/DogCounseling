# [3] Counseling Guide
## Dog Counseling Guide

#### 1. Guardian & Dog Profiling

> (1) Dog
- **Basic information**: Ddaengja (땡자), 16 weeks (approx. 4 months), Female (not neutered), Maltipoo
- **Adoption method**: Acquired from a pet shop.
- **Time since adoption**: The dog is currently 16 weeks old. The exact date of adoption is unclear, but it would have been within the last 8-10 weeks.
- **Lifestyle**: Lives indoors in an apartment with a family of three. Spends approximately 5 hours alone on weekdays.
- **Walking routine**: 4 times per week for 20 minutes each time.
- **Socialization**: Time spent with the mother dog is unknown, a common and significant factor for pet shop puppies. Has had limited, positive interactions with 11-20 people. Has had no close contact with other dogs.
- **Health history**: Has only received mandatory vaccinations. No other significant medical history.
- **Level of threatening/aggressive behavior**: None reported.
- **Triggers and levels of alertness/anxiety**: Shows normal puppy caution around loud noises like the vacuum cleaner. Is friendly and excited to meet visiting strangers. However, she becomes stiff and stares intently during veterinary exams, which is a clear sign of stress and anxiety in that specific context. She also follows her guardian everywhere, which indicates a strong attachment.
- **Temperament and disposition**:
    - **Chain of Thought**: The guardian describes Ddaengja as "not very fearful" and the survey indicates she is curious about new things. This points to a generally confident puppy. The high impulsivity score ("reacts immediately to stimuli") combined with her excited greetings for strangers suggests an energetic and sociable nature. However, the stiffness at the vet and the constant following of the guardian reveal an underlying layer of anxiety or dependency, especially in unfamiliar or potentially stressful situations. Her ability to learn "sit" shows she is trainable, but the fact she only does it for treats is typical for a puppy and indicates a need to generalize commands.
    - **Interpretation**: Ddaengja appears to be a typical puppy with a sociable, energetic, and impulsive temperament. Her confidence in familiar settings is high, but she displays clear signs of anxiety in stressful environments like the vet's office. Her early life in a pet shop, with unknown maternal separation time, is a critical factor that may influence her learning, attachment style, and ability to cope with stress.
- **Special notes**: The unknown history with her mother and littermates due to the pet shop origin is a significant developmental gap. This can impact bite inhibition, social skills with other dogs, and stress resilience. The lack of interaction with other dogs is a socialization window that is closing and should be addressed.

> (2) Guardian and Care Environment
- **Guardian (applicant) information**: 24-year-old female, serves as the primary caregiver (responsible for feeding, walks, and most daily care).
- **Family composition**: 3 adults, 1 dog (Ddaengja).
- **Living space**: A residence with 3 rooms, providing ample space.
- **Financial situation**: Spends approximately 200,000 KRW per month on pet care, which appears adequate for a puppy's needs.
- **Guardian characteristics**:
    - **Chain of Thought**: The guardian identifies as the primary caregiver, indicating a high level of commitment. Her description of the problem ("ㅠㅠㅠ") and her hopes for the future ("응아 잘 해보자ㅠㅜ") convey both deep affection and significant frustration. The primary focus on a single, tangible problem (potty training) suggests she may be feeling overwhelmed by this specific challenge, which is common for new puppy owners. Her expectation for counseling is very direct: "succeeding in potty training."
    - **Interpretation**: The guardian is loving and dedicated but is currently experiencing a high level of stress related to a specific puppy-rearing challenge. She is likely looking for practical, actionable advice to resolve the issue and alleviate her emotional burden. Her approach seems solution-oriented.
- **Special notes**: The family consists of three adults, which could be a great support system if everyone is aligned on training methods, or a source of inconsistency if they are not.

> (3) Pet Care Satisfaction
- **Emotional benefit**: High (62.5)
- **Emotional burden**: Very High (81.3)
- **Overall satisfaction**: Moderate (40.6)
- **Interpretation**:
    - **Chain of Thought**: The most striking data point is the "Very High" emotional burden, which significantly outweighs the "High" emotional benefit. This creates a satisfaction score that, while labeled "Moderate," indicates a state of distress. The guardian is feeling more stress and burden from caring for Ddaengja than joy and benefit. This is a critical state that, if unaddressed, can lead to caregiver burnout and negatively impact the human-dog bond.
    - **Interpretation**: The guardian is currently in a state of significant stress. The potty training issue is likely the primary contributor to this feeling of being overwhelmed. Counseling must prioritize not only solving the behavioral problem but also validating the guardian's feelings and providing strategies to reduce this burden. The goal is to shift the balance so that the emotional benefits of the relationship can flourish.

#### 2. Counseling Topics : Guardian’s Concerns and Root Causes
> Make the following content the central topic of the conversation.

- **Topic 1: Potty Training Failure (Feces Only)**
    - **Situation description**: Ddaengja, a 16-week-old puppy, consistently urinates on the potty pad but defecates in other locations, specifically in corners.
    - **Guardian's Needs**: The guardian's primary need is to acquire a practical and effective training method to resolve this specific potty training issue. A crucial secondary need is emotional support and a strategy to reduce her high level of caregiving stress and frustration.
    - **Possible causes**:
        - **Cause 1: Substrate and Location Preference**: Puppies often develop distinct preferences for urination and defecation spots. Ddaengja may have developed a preference for the texture of the floor in the corners or for the privacy and security that a corner provides, which is separate from her urination spot preference.
        - **Cause 2: Incomplete Training and Management**: At 16 weeks, a puppy's bladder and bowel control are still developing. The guardian may be expecting mastery too soon. The current management plan might not be sufficient to prevent accidents (e.g., lack of constant supervision), and the positive reinforcement for correct elimination may not be consistent or powerful enough to build a strong habit.
        - **Cause 3: Disrupted Denning Instinct from Pet Shop Origin**: Puppies raised in small pet shop enclosures are often forced to eliminate in their living space. This can weaken their natural instinct to keep their "den" clean, making house training more challenging than for a puppy raised in a different environment. She may not understand the concept of a single designated toilet area.
        - **Cause 4: Negative Association**: It's possible, though not stated, that an accident was punished near the pad, creating an aversion. Alternatively, the pad might be in a location that feels too exposed or busy for the more vulnerable act of defecation.

#### 3. Counseling Strategy

- **(0) Language**: 한국어

- **(1) Counseling Strategies**

    - **Topic 1: Potty Training Failure (Feces Only)**
        - **(1) Counseling Goals**
            - To provide the guardian with a clear, step-by-step management and training plan to successfully teach Ddaengja to defecate on the potty pad.
            - To adjust the guardian's expectations regarding the timeline for potty training, reframing it as a gradual learning process rather than a pass/fail test.
            - To directly address and reduce the guardian's "Very High" emotional burden by validating her feelings and empowering her with effective, positive strategies.

        - **(2) Contextual Strategies**
            - **Empathize and Validate First**: Begin by acknowledging the guardian's frustration. Say something like, "Potty training is one of the most stressful parts of having a new puppy, and it's so frustrating when they get one part right but not the other. It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed by this." Directly referencing the high burden score can also be powerful: "I saw in your survey that the emotional burden feels very high right now. Our main goal today is to give you a plan that makes you feel more in control and less stressed."
            - **Reframe the Problem (CBT)**: Shift the guardian's perspective from "She is failing" to "We are still learning." Use reframing: "The great news is that Ddaengja already understands the pad is for pottying—she's got the pee part down! That's a huge success. Now we just need to teach her that it's for poop, too. She's not being defiant; she's just developed a different preference that we need to gently change."
            - **Use a Dog's Perspective (Psychodrama)**: Help the guardian understand Ddaengja's motivation. Ask, "Let's imagine we are little Ddaengja. What might make a corner feel safer or more comfortable for pooping than the middle of a pad? Maybe it's quiet, enclosed, and feels more private. From her point of view, she's not making a 'mistake,' she's just choosing the spot that feels best to her."
            - **Provide a Concrete, Phased Action Plan**: Give a short-term (1-2 week) plan focused on management and positive reinforcement.
                - **Step 1 (Management is Key)**: Explain that preventing accidents is the first priority. Recommend crate training or using a playpen to limit her access to the "wrong" spots when unsupervised.
                - **Step 2 (Make the Right Spot Easy)**: Advise temporarily placing a potty pad directly in the corner where she has been having accidents. This meets her where she is.
                - **Step 3 (Jackpot Reward)**: Instruct the guardian to identify Ddaengja's pooping schedule (e.g., after meals, after waking) and take her to the pad at those times. When she poops on the pad, she should be rewarded with an extremely high-value "jackpot" treat (something special she only gets for this) and enthusiastic praise.
                - **Step 4 (Clean Thoroughly)**: Emphasize the need to clean all accident spots with an enzymatic cleaner to eliminate odor cues that attract her back to the same spot.

        - **(3) Cautions**
            - **Avoid Promising a Quick Fix**: Stress that potty training is a process that requires patience and consistency, especially for a 16-week-old puppy. There will still be accidents.
            - **Strongly Advise Against Punishment**: Explicitly warn the guardian that scolding, yelling, or any form of punishment for accidents will only create fear, damage their bond, and likely make Ddaengja afraid to poop in front of her, leading to more hiding and accidents.
            - **Explain the "Pet Shop Puppy" Factor**: Gently explain that because of her unknown early history, Ddaengja might take a little longer to learn than other puppies. This is not her fault, and it just means she needs extra patience and consistency.
            - **Mention Vet Check as a Precaution**: While unlikely to be the cause, state that if the behavior doesn't improve with consistent training, a check-up with the vet to rule out any gastrointestinal discomfort is always a good final step.

#### 4. Key Questions for Further Clarification

- **Topic 1: Potty Training Failure (Feces Only)**
    1.  Can you describe the exact routine? What happens right after Ddaengja eats a meal or wakes up from a nap? Where does she go? (This helps identify predictable moments for intervention.)
    2.  When you find that she has pooped in a corner, what has been your reaction so far? How do you clean it up? (This is to check for any unintentional punishment or use of non-enzymatic cleaners.)
    3.  What is the surface of the corners where she poops (e.g., hardwood, tile, near a rug)? And where are the potty pads located in the house? (This helps diagnose a potential surface or location preference.)
    4.  When she successfully urinates on the pad, what kind of reward or praise does she receive? How does that compare to the high-value "jackpot" treat we discussed? (This assesses the current reinforcement strategy.)
    5.  Are all three family members in the house following the same rules and reactions for potty training? (This checks for consistency, which is crucial for success.)

땡자가 울타리 안에서는 쉬야를 잘 하는데, 풀어주면 구석진 곳에 응아를 하는군요. 땡자의 마음속에는 아마도 '쉬야는 빨리 해결하고 싶고, 응아는 좀 더 안전하고 조용한 곳에서 하고 싶어!'라는 생각이 있을지도 몰라요.  

땡자가 구석진 곳에 응아를 했을 때, 보호자님은 어떻게 반응하셨나요? 그리고 그곳을 어떻게 치우셨는지도 궁금해요. 🐾

소가죽 우유 양치껌을 주시는군요. 어린 땡자에게 간식을 조심해서 주시는 마음이 느껴져요.  

땡자가 구석진 곳에 응아를 하는 것은, 어쩌면 그곳이 더 안전하고 사적인 공간이라고 느끼기 때문일 수 있어요. 마치 우리도 화장실을 찾을 때 조용하고 편안한 곳을 선호하는 것처럼요.  

혹시 땡자가 응아를 할 것 같은 특정 신호나 행동이 있나요? 예를 들어, 냄새를 맡거나 빙빙 도는 모습 같은 것이요. 🐾

네, 보호자님! 땡자가 응아를 패드에 잘 할 수 있도록, 단계별로 차근차근 알려드릴게요.  

### 🐾 Step 1: 응아 패드 존 만들기

> "땡자야, 응아는 여기에서 하는 거야!" 하고 땡자에게 명확하게 알려주는 시간이에요.  

1.  **패드 확장**: 땡자가 주로 응아를 하는 주방 구석이나 책상 밑에 배변 패드를 여러 장 깔아주세요. 땡자가 좋아하는 그 장소 자체가 화장실이 되는 거죠.  
2.  **울타리 활용**: 땡자가 냄새를 맡으며 빙글빙글 돌기 시작하면, 바로 땡자를 안아서 패드가 깔린 그 구석으로 데려가 주세요.  
3.  **조용한 기다림**: 땡자가 패드 위에서 응아를 할 때까지 조용히 기다려주세요. 이때는 칭찬이나 간섭 없이 땡자가 편안하게 볼일을 볼 수 있도록 해주세요.  

### 🎯 목표

- 땡자가 응아하고 싶을 때, 패드가 깔린 그 구석을 자연스럽게 찾도록 하는 거예요.  

### 🔎 주의 사항

- **절대 혼내지 마세요**: 땡자가 다른 곳에 응아를 해도 혼내지 마세요. 땡자는 아직 배우는 중이랍니다.  
- **효소 세정제 사용**: 응아 실수를 한 곳은 반드시 **효소 세정제**로 깨끗하게 닦아주세요. 일반 세제는 땡자의 코에는 여전히 응아 냄새가 남아있어 그곳을 다시 화장실로 인식하게 할 수 있어요.  
- **보상 타이밍**: 땡자가 패드 위에서 응아를 성공하는 순간, 바로 "옳지!" 하고 칭찬하며 땡자가 가장 좋아하는 간식(아주 작게 잘라서)을 주세요.  

어떠신가요? 이 첫 번째 단계, 보호자님과 땡자에게 도움이 될 것 같나요? ✨

보호자님의 걱정 충분히 이해해요. 울타리 옆 장판에 응아를 하거나, 안아가는 도중에 실수할까 봐 염려되시는군요.  

만약 땡자가 울타리 안에서 패드 옆 장판에 응아를 한다면, 그 장판 위에도 패드를 깔아주세요. 땡자가 응아를 하고 싶은 곳을 패드로 덮어주는 거죠.  

그리고 땡자를 안아 데려가는 도중에 응아를 한다면, 당황하지 마시고 조용히 패드 위에 내려놓아 마무리하게 해주세요. 땡자가 실수하더라도 혼내지 않는 것이 가장 중요해요. 🐾

근데 우리 배변판 두개를 씻어주면서 번갈아서 쓰는대 그럼 배변판 하나랑 옆에는 패드를 깔아주고 패드를 점점 치우라는거야? 패드에 익숙해지면 배변판에 안 올라가던데 패드에서 쉬야도 하고 쉬고 장난감도 놀고 그래서 배변판위에 있던것도 치워버리고 울타리 나올때만 구석에 패드 쓰거든…

네, 보호자님 말씀처럼 배변 패드를 점진적으로 줄여나가는 것이 맞아요. 땡자가 패드에서 쉬야도 하고 놀기도 한다면, 패드가 땡자에게는 편안한 공간으로 느껴지는 것 같아요.  

지금은 땡자가 응아를 하는 구석진 곳에 패드를 깔아주고, 땡자가 그곳에서 응아를 성공하면 칭찬과 보상을 충분히 해주세요. 땡자가 그곳을 '응아하는 곳'으로 확실히 인식하게 되면, 그때부터 패드의 크기를 조금씩 줄여나가거나 배변판으로 유도하는 다음 단계를 시작할 수 있어요. 🐾

네, 맞아요. 지금은 땡자가 응아를 하는 구석진 곳에 패드를 깔아주는 것이 중요해요. 땡자가 배변판에서 쉬야를 잘 하더라도, 응아는 다른 곳에서 하고 싶은 마음이 있을 수 있거든요.  

땡자가 응아를 패드 위에서 성공하면, 그때마다 "옳지!" 하고 크게 칭찬해주고, 땡자가 가장 좋아하는 간식을 바로 주세요. 이 과정을 꾸준히 반복하면 땡자가 '아, 여기에서 응아를 하면 칭찬받고 맛있는 걸 먹는구나!' 하고 배울 거예요. 🐾

비록 응아를 한 직후가 아니더라도, 땡자가 그 구석에서 응아를 하고 나면 칭찬받는다는 것을 연결 지을 수 있답니다. 🐾

네, 보호자님! 땡자의 배변 훈련을 위해 몇 가지 중요한 단계를 다시 한번 정리해 드릴게요.  

### 🐾 Step 1: 응아 패드 존 만들기 (이전 단계 복습)

> "땡자야, 응아는 여기에서 하는 거야!" 하고 땡자에게 명확하게 알려주는 시간이에요.  

1.  **패드 확장**: 땡자가 주로 응아를 하는 주방 구석이나 책상 밑, 그리고 울타리 안 배변판 옆 장판 위에도 배변 패드를 여러 장 깔아주세요. 땡자가 응아하고 싶어 하는 그 장소 자체를 화장실로 만들어주는 거죠.  
2.  **울타리 활용**: 땡자가 냄새를 맡으며 빙글빙글 돌기 시작하면, 바로 땡자를 안아서 패드가 깔린 그 구석이나 패드 위로 데려가 주세요.  
3.  **조용한 기다림**: 땡자가 패드 위에서 응아를 할 때까지 조용히 기다려주세요. 이때는 칭찬이나 간섭 없이 땡자가 편안하게 볼일을 볼 수 있도록 해주세요.  

### 🎯 목표

- 땡자가 응아하고 싶을 때, 패드가 깔린 그 구석을 자연스럽게 찾도록 하는 거예요.  

### 🔎 주의 사항

- **절대 혼내지 마세요**: 땡자가 다른 곳에 응아를 해도 혼내지 마세요. 땡자는 아직 배우는 중이랍니다.  
- **효소 세정제 사용**: 응아 실수를 한 곳은 반드시 **효소 세정제**로 깨끗하게 닦아주세요. 일반 세제는 땡자의 코에는 여전히 응아 냄새가 남아있어 그곳을 다시 화장실로 인식하게 할 수 있어요.  
- **보상 타이밍**: 땡자가 패드 위에서 응아를 성공하는 순간, 바로 "옳지!" 하고 크게 칭찬하며 땡자가 가장 좋아하는 간식(아주 작게 잘라서)을 주세요. 만약 칭찬 타이밍을 놓쳤다면, 응아를 끝내고 나올 때라도 칭찬과 간식을 주세요.  

이 방법으로 꾸준히 시도해 보시는 건 어떠세요? 🐾

보호자님, 땡자가 몸을 긁고 물고 꼬리를 쫓는 행동을 줄이고 편안하게 쉴 수 있도록, 몇 가지 방법을 알려드릴게요. ✨

### 🐾 Step 1: 땡자의 에너지를 건강하게 풀어주기

> 땡자가 몸을 긁거나 물고 꼬리를 쫓는 행동은 넘치는 에너지를 주체하지 못하거나, 지루함을 표현하는 방법일 수 있어요.  

1.  **노즈워크 놀이**: 매일 10~15분 정도 노즈워크 담요나 장난감을 활용해서 땡자의 에너지를 풀어주세요. 간식을 숨겨두면 땡자가 코를 사용해서 찾으면서 스트레스를 해소하고 집중력을 높일 수 있답니다.  
2.  **짧고 잦은 놀이 시간**: 하루에 여러 번 짧게(5~10분) 땡자가 좋아하는 장난감으로 놀아주세요. 특히 땡자가 몸을 긁거나 물기 시작할 때, 바로 놀이로 전환해서 관심을 돌려주는 것이 중요해요.  
3.  **긍정적인 관심 주기**: 땡자가 차분하게 쉬거나 다른 장난감을 가지고 놀 때, "옳지!" 하고 칭찬하며 간식을 주세요. 땡자가 긍정적인 행동을 했을 때 관심을 받는다는 것을 알려주는 거죠.  

### 🎯 목표

- 땡자가 몸을 긁거나 물고 꼬리를 쫓는 행동 대신, 건강한 방법으로 에너지를 발산하고 편안함을 느끼게 하는 거예요.  

### 🔎 주의 사항

- **피부 문제 확인**: 땡자가 몸을 긁어서 상처가 덧나는 상황이라면, 반드시 동물병원에 방문해서 피부 상태를 정확히 진단받고 치료를 병행해야 해요. 이 방법은 행동 교정을 위한 것이며, 피부 질환이 있다면 먼저 치료하는 것이 중요하답니다.  
- **일관성 유지**: 가족 구성원 모두가 땡자가 몸을 긁거나 물 때 같은 방법으로 반응하고, 노즈워크나 놀이 시간을 꾸준히 지켜주는 것이 중요해요.  

어떠신가요? 이 첫 번째 단계, 보호자님과 땡자에게 도움이 될 것 같나요? 🐾

[back_thinking_solution]: 1. The guardian needs a solution to reduce Ddaengja's excessive scratching, paw biting, and tail chasing, which seem to be related to energy levels, boredom, and attention-seeking. The guardian also needs guidance on how to react to these behaviors without reinforcing them negatively.
2. Constraints: Ddaengja cannot go for walks due to incomplete vaccinations, limiting physical exercise. The guardian's family is sensitive about Ddaengja's scratching due to existing wounds. The current reaction of saying "No" or "Don't" is not effective and might be causing stress. Personalized methods: Focus on indoor enrichment like nose work and short, frequent play sessions to manage energy. Emphasize positive reinforcement for calm behavior to shift attention-seeking. Address the underlying medical concern (scratching leading to wounds) by recommending a vet visit.
3. Alternatives: If the behaviors are purely medical, a vet visit is paramount. If behavioral, increasing mental stimulation (puzzle toys) and structured play could help. Desensitization to triggers (if any specific ones are identified for the self-mutilating behaviors) could also be considered for later stages. For now, the focus is on energy management and positive reinforcement.

네, 보호자님! 울타리에서 풀어두고 배변 훈련을 시킬 때, 땡자가 올바른 곳에서 응아를 할 수 있도록 돕는 방법을 알려드릴게요. ✨

### 🐾 Step 2: 자유시간에도 배변 성공률 높이기

> 땡자가 자유롭게 돌아다닐 때도 '응아는 패드에서!'라는 것을 기억하게 하는 시간이에요.  

1.  **배변 유도**: 땡자가 식사 후나 낮잠에서 깬 후, 또는 놀다가 갑자기 냄새를 맡으며 빙글빙글 돌기 시작하면, 바로 땡자를 안아서 패드가 깔린 구석이나 배변판 위로 데려가 주세요.  
2.  **칭찬과 보상**: 땡자가 패드 위에서 응아를 성공하면, 즉시 "옳지!" 하고 크게 칭찬하며 땡자가 가장 좋아하는 간식(아주 작게 잘라서)을 주세요. 땡자가 응아를 끝내고 나올 때라도 칭찬과 간식을 주는 것을 잊지 마세요.  
3.  **실수 시 대처**: 만약 땡자가 다른 곳에 응아를 했다면, 절대 혼내지 마시고 조용히 효소 세정제로 깨끗하게 치워주세요. 땡자가 실수한 곳에 다시 응아를 하지 않도록 냄새를 완전히 제거하는 것이 중요해요.  

### 🎯 목표

- 땡자가 자유시간에도 응아는 패드 위에서 해야 한다는 것을 명확히 인식하고, 스스로 패드를 찾아가도록 하는 거예요.  

### 🔎 주의 사항

- **눈을 떼지 마세요**: 땡자가 자유롭게 돌아다닐 때는 항상 주시하며 배변 신호를 놓치지 않도록 해주세요.  
- **일관된 반응**: 가족 구성원 모두가 땡자의 배변 성공에 대해 같은 방식으로 칭찬하고 보상해야 땡자가 혼란스러워하지 않아요.  
- **인내심**: 배변 훈련은 시간이 필요한 과정이에요. 땡자가 실수하더라도 꾸준히 긍정적인 방법으로 지도해 주세요.  

어떠신가요? 이 단계도 보호자님과 땡자에게 도움이 될 것 같나요? 🐾

[back_thinking_solution]: 1. The guardian needs guidance on how to manage potty training when Ddaengja is out of the crate, specifically focusing on defecation on the pad. She needs actionable steps for intervention and reinforcement during free time.
2. Constraints: Ddaengja's preference for corners for defecation and the guardian's past reaction (scolding) need to be addressed. The guardian is already doing some positive reinforcement for urination, but it needs to be applied more consistently and with higher value for defecation. The unknown early history from the pet shop might make the process slower, requiring more patience.
3. Alternatives: If the current approach doesn't yield results, consider temporarily confining Ddaengja to a smaller, pad-lined area during free time for shorter periods, gradually increasing the space as she shows consistency. Also, exploring different types of pads or a "grass patch" might be an option if substrate preference is very strong. For now, the focus is on consistent supervision, immediate positive reinforcement, and proper clean-up.
