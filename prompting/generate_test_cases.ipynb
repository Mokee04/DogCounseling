Guardian & Dog Profiling\\n\\n> (1) Dog\\n- **Basic information**: 땡자 (Ttaengja), 5.5 years old, female (neutered), Poodle\\n- **Adoption method**: Adopted from a pet shop.\\n- **Time since adoption**: Adopted at 39 weeks old (approximately 9 months).\\n- **Lifestyle**: Spends about 6 hours alone on weekdays. Lives indoors in an apartment.\\n- **Walking routine**: Twice a day, 20 minutes each time, totaling about 10 walks per week.\\n- **Socialization**: Time with mother dog is unknown. Adopted late (at 9 months), which is past the critical socialization period (3-16 weeks). Had limited interaction with people during this period. Reportedly does not play well with other dogs.\\n- **Health history**: Currently taking Apoquel for a skin condition, which often suggests allergies or atopic dermatitis.\\n- **Level of threatening/aggressive behavior**: None reported.\\n- **Triggers and levels of alertness/anxiety**: Avoids eye contact. Not eager to approach new environments or objects, suggesting a cautious nature rather than high anxiety. Seems calm with visitors and shows no signs of separation anxiety or resource guarding.\\n- **Temperament and disposition**:\\n    - **Rationale**: Based on the questionnaire, Ttaengja appears to be a calm and gentle dog on the surface. However, her history (pet shop origin, late adoption) combined with specific behaviors (avoiding eye contact, reluctance with new things, not playing well with other dogs) points towards an underlying temperament of **cautiousness and social insecurity**. She is not overtly anxious or fearful but lacks confidence in novel situations and social encounters. Her method of getting attention (staring, gentle pawing) is polite and non-demanding, indicating a mild and non-confrontational nature. The fact that she escalates behavior when a request is refused suggests she has learned ways to communicate her needs, albeit perhaps not in the most effective manner.\\n- **Special notes**: The late adoption from a pet shop is a critical factor. This often means missing out on crucial early learning from the mother and littermates, leading to deficits in social skills and confidence. Her skin condition could also be linked to stress, making it important to manage her emotional well-being.\\n\\n> (2) Guardian and Care Environment\\n- **Guardian (applicant) information**: 37-year-old male, secondary caregiver.\\n- **Family composition**: Two adults, one dog (Ttaengja). No children.\\n- **Living space**: Apartment with 4 rooms, providing ample space.\\n- **Financial situation**: Spends approximately 300,000 KRW/month on pet care, indicating a stable and committed care environment.\\n- **Guardian characteristics**:\\n    - **Rationale**: The guardian presents as highly empathetic and deeply bonded with Ttaengja. His primary concern is not a \"problem behavior\" but a philosophical one: \"how to make my dog happy.\" This shows a profound level of care and a desire to understand Ttaengja on a deeper level. As a **secondary caregiver**, his role and influence are significant but potentially limited or complicated by the primary caregiver\\'s actions and routines. His high satisfaction scores suggest he derives immense joy from the relationship but also feels a burden, likely stemming from his desire to do more for Ttaengja\\'s happiness.\\n- **Special notes**: The dynamic between the primary and secondary caregiver is a crucial, yet unknown, variable. Consistency in rules, training, and affection between the two guardians is essential for Ttaengja\\'s sense of security.\\n\\n> (3) Pet Care Satisfaction\\n- **Emotional benefit**: Very High (100.0)\\n- **Emotional burden**: Moderate (43.8)\\n- **Overall satisfaction**: High (78.1)\\n- **Interpretation**: These scores paint a picture of a very loving relationship. The guardian experiences the maximum possible emotional benefit from living with Ttaengja, indicating a deep bond. The moderate emotional burden likely arises from his concern about her well-being and his feeling of uncertainty about whether he is meeting all her needs for a happy life. The counseling goal is to reduce this burden by empowering him with knowledge and confidence, thereby making the relationship even more fulfilling.\\n\\n#### 2. Counseling Topics : Guardian’s Concerns and Root Causes\\n> Make the following content the central topic of the conversation.\\n\\n- **Topic 1: Understanding Ttaengja\\'s Psychological State to Enhance Her Happiness**\\n    - **Situation description**: The guardian\\'s main goal is to understand Ttaengja\\'s inner world and learn \"how to make a dog happy.\" He is not focused on a specific problem but on her overall quality of life and emotional state. He perceives her as calm but wants to ensure she is truly fulfilled.\\n    - **Guardian\\'s Needs**: This is primarily a need for **caregiving knowledge** and a **philosophical discussion** about canine well-being. He seeks to move beyond basic care and become a guardian who truly understands and enriches his dog\\'s life.\\n    - **Possible causes**: The guardian\\'s uncertainty likely stems from Ttaengja\\'s subtle signs of insecurity, which may not align with a simple picture of a \"happy dog.\"\\n        - **Cause 1: Social Insecurity Due to Early Life History**: Ttaengja\\'s background (pet shop, late adoption) is a strong predictor of social deficits. Her avoidance of eye contact and other dogs is not a choice but likely a result of not knowing how to engage confidently. The guardian may be sensing this underlying lack of confidence.\\n        - **Cause 2: Potential Under-Enrichment**: A routine of two 20-minute walks may not be sufficient mental and physical stimulation for an intelligent breed like a Poodle. This can lead to a state of quiet boredom or resignation, which can be mistaken for calmness. True happiness often comes from engagement, problem-solving, and exploration.\\n\\n- **Topic 2: Addressing Social Avoidance and Building Confidence**\\n    - **Situation description**: Ttaengja does not play well with other dogs and is hesitant in new situations. While not an aggressive issue, this limits her experiences and may be a source of low-level stress.\\n    - **Guardian\\'s Needs**: The guardian needs practical strategies to **improve a \"problem behavior\"** (social avoidance) and build Ttaengja\\'s confidence in a safe, positive way.\\n    - **Possible causes**:\\n        - **Cause 1: Lack of Social Skills**: Due to missing the critical socialization window, Ttaengja likely never learned the complex canine social etiquette for greetings and play. Her avoidance is a coping mechanism to prevent uncomfortable or scary situations.\\n        - **Cause 2: Inconsistent Handling or Past Negative Experiences**: There may have been past negative encounters with other dogs, or perhaps the guardians\\' own anxiety in social situations is being perceived by Ttaengja, reinforcing her hesitation.\\n\\n#### 3. Counseling Strategy\\n\\n- (0) Language: 한국어\\n\\n- (1) Counseling Strategies\\n\\n    - **Topic 1: Understanding Ttaengja\\'s Psychological State to Enhance Her Happiness**\\n        - **(1) Counseling Goals**:\\n            - Help the guardian reframe Ttaengja\\'s quiet behavior from just \"calm\" to \"cautious but capable,\" fostering empathy for her background.\\n            - Equip the guardian with the skills to observe and interpret Ttaengja\\'s subtle body language (e.g., lip licks, yawns, body tension) as communication.\\n            - Collaboratively define what a \"happy life\" looks like for Ttaengja specifically, focusing on confidence-building and enrichment rather than forcing her into a mold.\\n        - **(2) Contextual Strategies**:\\n            - **Empathy Building (Psychodrama)**: Use role-reversal. Ask, \"Imagine you are Ttaengja. You spent your first nine months in a shop, then came to a new home. When you see a big, unfamiliar dog approaching, what goes through your mind?\" This helps the guardian connect emotionally to her perspective.\\n            - **Reframing (CBT)**: Challenge the idea that happiness looks the same for all dogs. Reframe her behavior: \"Her avoidance of other dogs isn\\'t a sign of unhappiness, but a very smart strategy she developed to keep herself feeling safe. Our goal is to show her she can feel safe without having to avoid everything.\"\\n            - **Guided Imagery**: Ask the guardian to describe a perfect, happy day for Ttaengja. \"If Ttaengja could plan her own perfect day, what would she choose to do? Where would she go? Who would she be with?\" This reveals the guardian\\'s values and helps build a positive, goal-oriented vision.\\n        - **(3) Cautions**:\\n            - Avoid anthropomorphism. Do not project complex human emotions like \"sadness\" or \"loneliness\" onto Ttaengja. Instead, focus on observable behaviors related to stress, confidence, and engagement.\\n            - Validate the guardian\\'s deep love for his dog. His concern comes from a good place. The counseling should feel like a partnership to enhance an already great bond.\\n            - Emphasize that the primary caregiver\\'s involvement is crucial. Any new understanding or approach must be shared and practiced consistently by both caregivers.\\n\\n    - **Topic 2: Addressing Social Avoidance and Building Confidence**\\n        - **(1) Counseling Goals**:\\n            - Provide a short-term action plan (1-2 weeks) for introducing low-stress enrichment activities (e.g., nose work, puzzle toys).\\n            - Teach the guardian a safe, structured method for building Ttaengja\\'s neutrality and confidence around other dogs and in new places (e.g., parallel walking).\\n            - Increase the guardian\\'s confidence in his ability to manage situations and advocate for Ttaengja\\'s needs.\\n        - **(2) Contextual Strategies**:\\n            - **Provide an Action Plan**: Suggest concrete, easy-to-implement solutions. For example: \"For the next two weeks, let\\'s change one of the 20-minute walks into a \\'sniffari.\\' Let Ttaengja lead the way and sniff as much as she wants. The goal isn\\'t distance, but exploration.\" Also, introduce one new puzzle toy.\\n            - **Scenario Reenactment**: Use a fictional case study. \"I once counseled a dog friend of Ttaengja\\'s, a Bichon named Bori, who was also very shy. His guardian learned to walk him on the other side of the street from other dogs. Bori learned that he could see dogs without having to interact, and he became much calmer on walks. Could we try something similar for Ttaengja?\"\\n            - **Focus on Management**: Explain that management is not failure. Using distance and avoiding forced interactions is a key part of responsible guardianship for a socially sensitive dog.\\n        - **(3) Cautions**:\\n            - **Strongly advise against dog parks, crowded pet cafes, or any off-leash, uncontrolled social situations.** This could be traumatic and set back progress significantly.\\n            - Remind the guardian that progress will be slow and non-linear. Celebrate small successes, like Ttaengja looking at another dog from a distance without tensing up.\\n            - Connect behavior to health. Mention that reducing chronic stress through confidence-building may have a positive impact on her skin condition. Recommend discussing any major behavioral changes or stressors with their veterinarian.\\n\\n#### 4. Key Questions for Further Clarification\\n\\n- **Topic 1: Understanding Ttaengja\\'s Psychological State to Enhance Her Happiness**\\n    - You mentioned you are the secondary caregiver. Could you please describe the primary caregiver\\'s daily routine and interaction style with Ttaengja? How are rules, training, and affection handled between the two of you?\\n    - When you say Ttaengja \"escalates her behavior\" if a request is refused, can you give me a specific example? What does she ask for, and what does the escalation look like?\\n    - Can you describe Ttaengja\\'s body language in detail when she avoids eye contact? What are her ears, tail, and mouth doing in that moment?\\n    - What are Ttaengja\\'s favorite things in the world? What makes her tail wag the most?\\n\\n- **Topic 2: Addressing Social Avoidance and Building Confidence**\\n    - Could you describe a typical 20-minute walk? Is it a structured heel, a quick potty break, or does she have freedom to explore and sniff?\\n    - When you say she \"doesn\\'t play well with other dogs,\" can you describe a specific recent encounter? What did the other dog do, and how did Ttaengja react (e.g., freeze, try to leave, growl, ignore)?\\n    - What kinds of toys does she have, and how does she typically play with them? Does she ever bring them to you to initiate play?\\n    - Regarding her skin condition, have you noticed if flare-ups seem to coincide with stressful events, changes in routine, or specific seasons?\\n\\n\\n\\n# [4] Chat Record\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [1] Model\\n\\n\\n[back_current_phase]: [\\'[phase4] Transitioning Topics\\']\\n\\n[back_current_topic]: Initial Message\\n\\n[back_process_rate]: 0%\\n\\n[back_user_emotion]: 2\\n\\n안녕하세요, 사색을 좋아하는 비글이자 반려견 마음 통역사 까미예요. 🐶  \\n땡자의 속마음을 더 깊이 읽어 보고, 우리 보호자님과 함께 잔잔한 파도를 넘어 보려고 해요.  \\n### 상담 안내  \\n보호자님께서는 땡자와의 반려 생활에서 아주 깊은 만족감을 느끼고 계시네요.  \\n최고의 정서적 유대감을 경험하시면서도, 땡자의 행복에 대한 고민을 안고 계신 모습이 참 인상 깊어요.  \\n이제 우리는 땡자라는 바다에 뛰어들어, 반려견을 천천히 이해해 나아갈 거예요.  \\n### 대화를 시작해 볼게요.  \\n1. 땡자의 행복을 위한 심리 상태 이해하기  \\n2. 사회성 부족 문제 다루기 및 자신감 키우기  \\n보호자님께서 전달해 주신 고민 내용들이에요.  \\n어떤 주제에 대해 먼저 이야기해 보고 싶으세요?\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [2] User\\n\\n\\n사료좀 선택도와줘요\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [3] Model\\n\\n\\n[back_current_phase]: [\\'[phase1] Information Gathering\\']\\n\\n[back_current_topic]: 사료 선택\\n\\n[back_process_rate]: 0%\\n\\n[back_user_emotion]: 2\\n\\n사료 선택은 땡자의 건강과 행복에 아주 중요한 부분이지요. 🐾  \\n땡자의 식습관과 건강 상태에 맞춰 가장 좋은 선택을 할 수 있도록 제가 도와드릴게요.  \\n혹시 땡자가 현재 먹고 있는 사료는 무엇인가요?

Guardian & Dog Profiling\\n\\n> (1) Dog\\n- **Basic information**: Kuro, 6 months old, male (intact), Shiba Inu.\\n- **Adoption method**: Adopted from a pet shop at 10 weeks of age.\\n- **Time since adoption**: Approximately 4 months.\\n- **Lifestyle**: Spends very little time alone (approx. 1 hour on weekdays) as one guardian is always home. This lack of practice being alone is a key factor in the counseling topics.\\n- **Walking routine**: Excellent and consistent routine of one 60-minute walk every day.\\n- **Socialization**: Appears well-socialized with people and other dogs. Plays well and shows confidence, but may lack subtlety in reading other dogs\\' cues (e.g., ignoring growls), which is typical for a confident puppy but requires monitoring.\\n- **Health history**: No known health issues.\\n- **Level of threatening/aggressive behavior**: None reported. The dog is described as friendly and confident.\\n- **Triggers and levels of alertness/anxiety**: The primary trigger for anxiety is the guardian preparing to leave, which results in howling. The dog also exhibits \"Velcro\" behavior (following the guardian everywhere), indicating a strong attachment that could develop into separation anxiety.\\n- **Temperament and disposition**:\\n    - **Rationale**: Based on the questionnaire, Kuro is a highly confident, social, and energetic puppy. His eagerness to greet strangers and other dogs, coupled with his quick learning of commands, points to high intelligence and adaptability (Confidence Type \\'C\\' in the CAMI model). His immediate reaction to stimuli suggests high energy (Dynamic Type \\'E\\'). His friendliness towards dogs and people suggests a relationship-oriented nature (Relationship-Oriented \\'S\\'). His lack of reaction to growls could be interpreted as pragmatic and focused on his own exploration (Agile Type \\'A\\'). This would align him with the **ESCA (자유로운 영혼의 협상가 - Free-spirited Negotiator)** or **ESCF (열정적인 탐구자 - Passionate Explorer)** type. He is curious, bold, and driven by social interaction and exploration.\\n- **Special notes**: The early socialization history (before 10 weeks) is unknown due to adoption from a pet shop. This is a critical period, and any deficits from that time could emerge later. His current lack of fear is a positive sign, but his inability to read negative social cues (growling) needs to be managed to prevent future negative encounters.\\n\\n> (2) Guardian and Care Environment\\n- **Guardian (applicant) information**: 32-year-old female, primary caregiver.\\n- **Family composition**: Two adults, one dog (Kuro). One guardian is always at home.\\n- **Living space**: Apartment with 3 rooms, providing adequate space.\\n- **Financial situation**: Stable, with a dedicated monthly budget for pet care.\\n- **Guardian characteristics**:\\n    - **Rationale**: The guardian is highly proactive, insightful, and motivated. She is not waiting for problems to become severe but is seeking to prevent them (\"concern about separation anxiety\"). Her desire for \"understanding the dog\" shows a deep commitment to the dog\\'s welfare beyond simple obedience. The high satisfaction scores confirm a strong, positive bond. She is an ideal candidate for coaching as she is likely to be consistent and dedicated to implementing training plans.\\n- **Special notes**: The fact that one person is always home is a double-edged sword. While it provides companionship for Kuro, it is the direct cause of his lack of experience with being alone, which is the root of the separation anxiety concern.\\n\\n> (3) Pet Care Satisfaction\\n- **Emotional benefit**: Very High (100)\\n- **Emotional burden**: Very Low (12.5)\\n- **Overall satisfaction**: Very High (93.8)\\n- **Interpretation**:\\n    - **Rationale**: These scores are exceptionally positive. They indicate that the guardian derives immense joy and emotional fulfillment from her relationship with Kuro, and perceives the challenges of caregiving as minimal. This strong positive foundation is the greatest asset in counseling. It means the guardian has the emotional resilience and motivation to work through challenges patiently and consistently. Our counseling should leverage this positivity, framing training not as \"fixing problems\" but as \"enriching their already wonderful relationship.\"\\n\\n#### 2. Counseling Topics : Guardian’s Concerns and Root Causes\\n> Make the following content the central topic of the conversation.\\n\\n-  **Topic 1: Proactive Management of Potential Separation Anxiety**\\n    - **Situation description**: Kuro is almost never left alone because a family member is always home. When the guardians prepare to leave, even for a short time, Kuro howls. He also follows his primary guardian everywhere in the house. The guardian is concerned this will develop into a significant separation anxiety issue.\\n    - **Guardian\\'s Needs**: To understand why this is happening and to learn preventive training techniques. The ultimate goal is for Kuro to feel secure and calm when left alone, aligning with the guardian\\'s stated hope for his future.\\n    - **Possible causes**:\\n        - **Cause 1: Lack of Practice Being Alone**: This is the most direct cause. A dog who is never alone does not have the opportunity to learn that solitude is safe and that the guardian will always return. Being alone is an unpracticed and therefore unsettling skill for him.\\n        - **Cause 2: Hyper-Attachment**: The constant presence and attention from the guardians have fostered an extremely strong, dependent bond. The \"Velcro dog\" behavior (following) and howling are symptoms of this hyper-attachment. He sees the guardian as his source of safety and entertainment, and their absence is highly dysregulating for him.\\n\\n- **Topic 2: House-Training Preference (Refusal to Defecate Indoors)**\\n    - **Situation description**: Kuro consistently refuses to defecate inside the house, holding it until his daily walk.\\n    - **Guardian\\'s Needs**: To understand the reason for this behavior and to explore whether it\\'s a problem that needs solving.\\n    - **Possible causes**:\\n        - **Cause 1: Strong Substrate Preference**: Kuro has successfully learned that \"outside\" (grass, soil) is the correct place to defecate. He has developed a strong, exclusive preference for this substrate and environment, which is a sign of successful house-training from one perspective.\\n        - **Cause 2: Inadvertent Conditioning**: The guardian has likely been very effective at rewarding outdoor potty breaks. This positive reinforcement may have unintentionally taught Kuro that outside is the *only* acceptable location, rather than just the *preferred* one. He may view pooping inside as \"breaking the rules.\"\\n\\n#### 3. Counseling Strategy\\n> Develop a guideline for effectively implementing the following\\n\\n- (0) Language: 한국어 (Korean)\\n\\n- (1) Counseling Strategies\\n\\n    - **Topic 1: Proactive Management of Potential Separation Anxiety**\\n        - **(1) Counseling Goals**\\n            - The guardian will reframe the issue from a \"future problem\" to a \"present skill\" that needs to be taught.\\n            - The guardian will learn and feel confident implementing a step-by-step protocol for teaching Kuro to be comfortable alone.\\n            - Within 2-4 weeks, Kuro will be able to remain calm for short, planned departures of 5-15 minutes without howling.\\n        - **(2) Contextual Strategies**\\n            - **Validate and Empower (Phase 2: Caring for Guardian\\'s Mind)**: Begin by praising the guardian\\'s foresight. \"It\\'s wonderful that you\\'re addressing this now. You\\'re being very proactive in setting Kuro up for lifelong success. We\\'re not fixing a problem; we\\'re building a skill for his future well-being.\"\\n            - **Reframe using CBT (Phase 2)**: Shift the guardian\\'s thought from \"I\\'m worried about his separation anxiety\" to \"Kuro hasn\\'t had the chance to learn that being alone is okay. My job is to be a patient teacher.\" This transforms anxiety into a sense of purpose.\\n            - **Use Psychodrama (Monologue - Phase 2)**: Explain Kuro\\'s perspective. \"Imagine you\\'re Kuro. Your favorite person has been with you almost every minute of your life. When they suddenly start getting ready to disappear behind a big door, you don\\'t have any past experience to tell you they\\'ll come back. Your howl isn\\'t being \\'bad,\\' it\\'s a question: \\'Wait, what\\'s happening? This is new! Are you coming back for me?\\'\"\\n            - **Provide a Gradual Action Plan (Phase 3: Caregiving Solutions)**: Introduce a clear, structured plan focused on building independence.\\n                1.  **Desensitize Departure Cues**: Instruct the guardian to jingle keys, put on a coat, and pick up a bag multiple times a day *without leaving*. This breaks the association between these cues and the stress of departure.\\n                2.  **\"Station\" Training**: Teach Kuro to go to a specific mat or bed and stay there, rewarding him for calm behavior. Gradually increase the distance between the guardian and the station.\\n                3.  **Structured Alone Time**: Start with \"alone time\" while the guardian is still home, using a baby gate to separate rooms. Provide a very high-value, long-lasting chew (e.g., a frozen Kong) that he *only* gets during this time. Begin with 1-2 minutes and slowly increase.\\n                4.  **Practice Real Departures**: Once he is calm with in-home separation, practice leaving through the door for just 30 seconds, returning before he can get anxious. Keep arrivals and departures completely calm and boring.\\n        - **(3) Cautions**\\n            - **Crucially, advise the guardian to never leave Kuro to \"cry it out.\"** This method can sensitize the dog and worsen anxiety. The key is to return *before* the anxiety starts.\\n            - Remind the guardian that progress will not be linear. There will be good days and bad days. Consistency is more important than perfection.\\n            - If at any point Kuro\\'s anxiety escalates (e.g., destructive behavior, excessive drooling, self-harm), they must be advised to seek help from a veterinarian or a certified veterinary behaviorist, as medication may be needed alongside training.\\n\\n    - **Topic 2: House-Training Preference (Refusal to Defecate Indoors)**\\n        - **(1) Counseling Goals**\\n            - The guardian will understand that this behavior is a sign of successful house-training, not a behavioral problem.\\n            - The guardian will make an informed decision about whether teaching indoor defecation is truly necessary for their lifestyle.\\n            - If desired, the guardian will learn a low-pressure method to introduce an indoor potty option.\\n        - **(2) Contextual Strategies**\\n            - **Information Gathering (Phase 1)**: Start by asking the key questions listed below, especially: \"Is this behavior actually causing a problem for you, or are you just curious?\" The entire strategy hinges on this answer.\\n            - **Reframe the \"Refusal\" (Phase 2: CBT)**: Positively reframe the behavior. \"This isn\\'t a \\'refusal.\\' This is Kuro showing you how well he has learned the rules! You\\'ve done such a fantastic job of teaching him that \\'outside is the potty\\' that he\\'s following that rule perfectly. We should celebrate that success first.\"\\n            - **Philosophical Discussion (Phase 3: Knowledge-based)**: Engage the guardian\\'s desire for \"understanding.\" Discuss the pros and cons of an outside-only dog. Pros: a very clean house, a strong routine. Cons: inconvenience during illness, extreme weather, or travel. Allow the guardian to lead the conversation and decide what they prefer.\\n            - **Provide an Optional Action Plan (Phase 3: Caregiving Solutions)**: If the guardian decides they want an indoor option for emergencies:\\n                1.  **Explain the Difficulty**: Set realistic expectations. \"Because he\\'s learned the outdoor rule so well, teaching a new, indoor rule can be a slow process. We need to be very patient.\"\\n                2.  **Scent Association**: Suggest taking a paper towel used to clean up his poop outside (or a tiny piece of the stool itself) and placing it on the indoor pee pad to transfer the \"potty\" scent.\\n                3.  **Management and Timing**: Take him to the indoor pad on a leash immediately upon waking or after a crate session, using a verbal cue like \"Go potty.\" If he doesn\\'t go after a few minutes, take him outside to succeed, and try the indoor spot again next time.\\n        - **(3) Cautions**\\n            - Stress that this is not a necessary behavior to \"fix.\" For many owners, a dog that only eliminates outside is the ideal outcome. Avoid making the guardian feel like a failure if Kuro never takes to an indoor spot.\\n            - Advise against any form of punishment or scolding. This will only create anxiety around potty time in general and damage their bond.\\n            - Ensure the guardian understands this is about creating an \"emergency option,\" not replacing his primary, successful outdoor routine.\\n\\n#### 4. Key Questions for Further Clarification\\n\\n- **Topic 1: Proactive Management of Potential Separation Anxiety**\\n    - Can you describe Kuro\\'s behavior in more detail from the moment you start preparing to leave until after the door is closed? (To identify specific triggers.)\\n    - How do you and the other guardian typically say goodbye to Kuro when you do leave? Is it a long, emotional farewell or quick and neutral? (To check for unintentional reinforcement of anxiety.)\\n    - When Kuro follows you from room to room, what does he do? Does he need to be in physical contact, or is just being in the same room enough? (To assess the intensity of the hyper-attachment.)\\n    - Have you ever tried giving him a special puzzle toy or a long-lasting treat to occupy him as you leave? If so, how did he react? (To understand what has already been attempted.)\\n\\n- **Topic 2: House-Training Preference (Refusal to Defecate Indoors)**\\n    - Is Kuro\\'s refusal to poop inside causing any practical problems for your schedule or lifestyle, or are you asking more out of curiosity? (This is the most critical question to determine the actual need.)\\n    - Does Kuro have a predictable pooping schedule during his walk (e.g., always in the first 10 minutes)?

(밖에서 간식을 잘 먹지 않는다면, 칭찬의 강도를 높여주세요.)\\n    3. **부드러운 방향 전환**: 쿠로가 보호자님께 집중하면, 부드럽게 리드줄을 당겨 방향을 바꿔 공격적인 강아지에게서 멀리 벗어나세요. 풀숲으로 장소를 전환하는 것도 좋은 방법이에요.\\n    4. **안전한 곳에서 보상**: 안전한 거리로 벗어난 후, 쿠로가 차분해지면 다시 칭찬과 함께 쿠로가 좋아하는 장난감으로 짧게 놀아주세요.\\n\\n🎯 **목표**\\n\\n- 쿠로가 다른 강아지의 공격적인 신호를 무시하기보다는, 그 신호를 인지하고 보호자님과 함께 안전하게 상황을 피하는 방법을 배우는 거예요. 이는 쿠로가 스스로를 보호하는 능력을 키우는 데 도움이 된답니다.\\n\\n🔎 **주의 사항**\\n\\n- 이 훈련은 쿠로가 위험한 상황을 인지하고 스스로를 보호하는 능력을 키우는 데 초점을 맞춰야 해요.\\n- 밖에서 간식을 잘 먹지 않는 쿠로를 위해, 칭찬의 강도를 높이거나, 쿠로가 정말 좋아하는 아주 작은 크기의 특별한 간식(예: 삶은 닭가슴살 조각)을 사용해 보세요.\\n- 훈련 중에도 쿠로가 다른 강아지에게 달려들거나 짖지 않도록 리드줄을 짧게 잡고 안전하게 통제해 주세요.\\n- 만약 쿠로가 공격적인 강아지에게 지속적으로 노출되거나, 심한 불안 증세를 보인다면 동물병원이나 전문 훈련사와 상담하는 것이 필요해요.\\n\\n어떠신가요? 쿠로가 다른 강아지들과의 만남을 더 현명하고 안전하게 즐길 수 있도록 돕는 이 방법, 시도해 보실 준비 되셨나요? ✨\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [364] User\\n\\n\\n응응 쿠로가 중형견이라 소형견이 공격적인거야?\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [365] Model\\n\\n\\n[back_current_topic]: Socialization with Other Dogs\\n\\n[back_current_phase]: [\\'[phase1] Information Gathering\\', \"[phase2] Caring the Dog\\'s/Guardian\\'s Mind\"]\\n\\n[back_user_emotion]: 2\\n\\n[back_process_rate]: 0%\\n\\n네, 쿠로가 중형견이라 소형견이 공격적인 것인지 궁금하시군요. 😥\\n\\n쿠로의 마음은 아마 \"나는 그냥 친구가 되고 싶은데, 왜 저 친구들은 나를 무서워할까?\" 하고 생각할 수 있어요. 강아지들은 자신보다 덩치가 큰 상대를 위협적으로 느낄 수 있답니다. 🐾\\n\\n혹시 소형견들이 쿠로에게 공격적인 반응을 보일 때, 쿠로는 어떤 행동을 보이나요? 예를 들어, 피하거나, 으르렁거리거나, 아니면 가만히 있나요?\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [366] User\\n\\n\\n쿠로는 유연하게 대처해 \\n짖으면 살짝 덜 다가가고 물려고하면 자리피해주고 물려도 강아지한테 절대 입질안해 착한 강아지인데 속상하네\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [367] Model\\n\\n\\n[back_current_topic]: Socialization with Other Dogs\\n\\n[back_current_phase]: [\"[phase2] Caring the Dog\\'s/Guardian\\'s Mind\", \\'[phase3] Caregiving Solutions\\']\\n\\n[back_user_emotion]: 2\\n\\n[back_process_rate]: 100%\\n\\n쿠로가 짖으면 덜 다가가고, 물려고 하면 자리를 피해 주며, 물려도 절대 입질하지 않는다니, 정말 유연하고 착한 친구네요! 💖 보호자님께서 속상해하시는 마음은 충분히 이해가 가요. 😥\\n\\n쿠로의 마음은 아마 \"나는 친구들이랑 잘 지내고 싶은데, 왜 친구들은 나를 무서워할까?\" 하고 답답해할 것 같아요. 쿠로의 이런 행동은 강아지 사회에서 \\'갈등 회피\\' 또는 \\'진정 신호\\'를 보내는 것이랍니다. 🐾\\n\\n중형견인 쿠로가 소형견에게 공격적인 반응을 유발하는 몇 가지 이유가 있을 수 있어요. 첫째, **체구 차이** 때문에 소형견들이 쿠로를 위협적으로 느낄 수 있어요. 둘째, 쿠로의 **높은 에너지 레벨**이 소형견에게는 부담스럽게 다가갈 수 있답니다. 셋째, 쿠로가 **다른 강아지의 카밍 시그널(불편함, 멈춤 신호)**을 잘 읽지 못해서, 소형견들이 보내는 \\'이제 그만!\\'이라는 신호를 무시하고 계속 다가가려 할 수 있어요.\\n\\n이제 쿠로가 다른 강아지들과 더 조화롭게 어울리고, 보호자님께서도 속상해하지 않으시도록 돕는 마지막 방법을 알아볼까요? ✨\\n\\n### 🐾 Step 3: \\'소형견 놀이 에티켓\\' 가르치기\\n\\n- **준비물**: 쿠로가 가장 좋아하는 간식 (애견 카페에서도 먹을 수 있는 아주 특별한 간식), 리드줄\\n- **방법** (소형견을 만났을 때):\\n    1. **조기 발견 및 거리 유지**: 소형견을 발견하면, 쿠로가 흥분하거나 낑낑거리기 **전**에 충분한 거리를 유지하세요. 쿠로가 소형견을 인식하되, 아직 불안해하지 않는 정도의 거리가 좋아요.\\n    2. **\\'앉아\\' 또는 \\'기다려\\' 지시**: 쿠로에게 \"앉아\" 또는 \"기다려\" 지시를 하고, 쿠로가 차분하게 앉으면 즉시 \"옳지!\"라고 칭찬하며 간식을 주세요.

Guardian & Dog Profiling\\n\\n> (1) Dog\\n- **Basic information**: 땡자 (Ttaengja), 5.5 years old, female (neutered), Poodle\\n- **Adoption method**: Adopted from a pet shop.\\n- **Time since adoption**: Adopted at 39 weeks old (approximately 9 months).\\n- **Lifestyle**: Spends about 6 hours alone on weekdays. Lives indoors in an apartment.\\n- **Walking routine**: Twice a day, 20 minutes each time, totaling about 10 walks per week.\\n- **Socialization**: Time with mother dog is unknown. Adopted late (at 9 months), which is past the critical socialization period (3-16 weeks). Had limited interaction with people during this period. Reportedly does not play well with other dogs.\\n- **Health history**: Currently taking Apoquel for a skin condition, which often suggests allergies or atopic dermatitis.\\n- **Level of threatening/aggressive behavior**: None reported.\\n- **Triggers and levels of alertness/anxiety**: Avoids eye contact. Not eager to approach new environments or objects, suggesting a cautious nature rather than high anxiety. Seems calm with visitors and shows no signs of separation anxiety or resource guarding.\\n- **Temperament and disposition**:\\n    - **Rationale**: Based on the questionnaire, Ttaengja appears to be a calm and gentle dog on the surface. However, her history (pet shop origin, late adoption) combined with specific behaviors (avoiding eye contact, reluctance with new things, not playing well with other dogs) points towards an underlying temperament of **cautiousness and social insecurity**. She is not overtly anxious or fearful but lacks confidence in novel situations and social encounters. Her method of getting attention (staring, gentle pawing) is polite and non-demanding, indicating a mild and non-confrontational nature. The fact that she escalates behavior when a request is refused suggests she has learned ways to communicate her needs, albeit perhaps not in the most effective manner.\\n- **Special notes**: The late adoption from a pet shop is a critical factor. This often means missing out on crucial early learning from the mother and littermates, leading to deficits in social skills and confidence. Her skin condition could also be linked to stress, making it important to manage her emotional well-being.\\n\\n> (2) Guardian and Care Environment\\n- **Guardian (applicant) information**: 37-year-old male, secondary caregiver.\\n- **Family composition**: Two adults, one dog (Ttaengja). No children.\\n- **Living space**: Apartment with 4 rooms, providing ample space.\\n- **Financial situation**: Spends approximately 300,000 KRW/month on pet care, indicating a stable and committed care environment.\\n- **Guardian characteristics**:\\n    - **Rationale**: The guardian presents as highly empathetic and deeply bonded with Ttaengja. His primary concern is not a \"problem behavior\" but a philosophical one: \"how to make my dog happy.\" This shows a profound level of care and a desire to understand Ttaengja on a deeper level. As a **secondary caregiver**, his role and influence are significant but potentially limited or complicated by the primary caregiver\\'s actions and routines. His high satisfaction scores suggest he derives immense joy from the relationship but also feels a burden, likely stemming from his desire to do more for Ttaengja\\'s happiness.\\n- **Special notes**: The dynamic between the primary and secondary caregiver is a crucial, yet unknown, variable. Consistency in rules, training, and affection between the two guardians is essential for Ttaengja\\'s sense of security.\\n\\n> (3) Pet Care Satisfaction\\n- **Emotional benefit**: Very High (100.0)\\n- **Emotional burden**: Moderate (43.8)\\n- **Overall satisfaction**: High (78.1)\\n- **Interpretation**: These scores paint a picture of a very loving relationship. The guardian experiences the maximum possible emotional benefit from living with Ttaengja, indicating a deep bond. The moderate emotional burden likely arises from his concern about her well-being and his feeling of uncertainty about whether he is meeting all her needs for a happy life. The counseling goal is to reduce this burden by empowering him with knowledge and confidence, thereby making the relationship even more fulfilling.\\n\\n#### 2. Counseling Topics : Guardian’s Concerns and Root Causes\\n> Make the following content the central topic of the conversation.\\n\\n- **Topic 1: Understanding Ttaengja\\'s Psychological State to Enhance Her Happiness**\\n    - **Situation description**: The guardian\\'s main goal is to understand Ttaengja\\'s inner world and learn \"how to make a dog happy.\" He is not focused on a specific problem but on her overall quality of life and emotional state. He perceives her as calm but wants to ensure she is truly fulfilled.\\n    - **Guardian\\'s Needs**: This is primarily a need for **caregiving knowledge** and a **philosophical discussion** about canine well-being. He seeks to move beyond basic care and become a guardian who truly understands and enriches his dog\\'s life.\\n    - **Possible causes**: The guardian\\'s uncertainty likely stems from Ttaengja\\'s subtle signs of insecurity, which may not align with a simple picture of a \"happy dog.\"\\n        - **Cause 1: Social Insecurity Due to Early Life History**: Ttaengja\\'s background (pet shop, late adoption) is a strong predictor of social deficits. Her avoidance of eye contact and other dogs is not a choice but likely a result of not knowing how to engage confidently. The guardian may be sensing this underlying lack of confidence.\\n        - **Cause 2: Potential Under-Enrichment**: A routine of two 20-minute walks may not be sufficient mental and physical stimulation for an intelligent breed like a Poodle. This can lead to a state of quiet boredom or resignation, which can be mistaken for calmness. True happiness often comes from engagement, problem-solving, and exploration.\\n\\n- **Topic 2: Addressing Social Avoidance and Building Confidence**\\n    - **Situation description**: Ttaengja does not play well with other dogs and is hesitant in new situations. While not an aggressive issue, this limits her experiences and may be a source of low-level stress.\\n    - **Guardian\\'s Needs**: The guardian needs practical strategies to **improve a \"problem behavior\"** (social avoidance) and build Ttaengja\\'s confidence in a safe, positive way.\\n    - **Possible causes**:\\n        - **Cause 1: Lack of Social Skills**: Due to missing the critical socialization window, Ttaengja likely never learned the complex canine social etiquette for greetings and play. Her avoidance is a coping mechanism to prevent uncomfortable or scary situations.\\n        - **Cause 2: Inconsistent Handling or Past Negative Experiences**: There may have been past negative encounters with other dogs, or perhaps the guardians\\' own anxiety in social situations is being perceived by Ttaengja, reinforcing her hesitation.\\n\\n#### 3. Counseling Strategy\\n\\n- (0) Language: 한국어\\n\\n- (1) Counseling Strategies\\n\\n    - **Topic 1: Understanding Ttaengja\\'s Psychological State to Enhance Her Happiness**\\n        - **(1) Counseling Goals**:\\n            - Help the guardian reframe Ttaengja\\'s quiet behavior from just \"calm\" to \"cautious but capable,\" fostering empathy for her background.\\n            - Equip the guardian with the skills to observe and interpret Ttaengja\\'s subtle body language (e.g., lip licks, yawns, body tension) as communication.\\n            - Collaboratively define what a \"happy life\" looks like for Ttaengja specifically, focusing on confidence-building and enrichment rather than forcing her into a mold.\\n        - **(2) Contextual Strategies**:\\n            - **Empathy Building (Psychodrama)**: Use role-reversal. Ask, \"Imagine you are Ttaengja. You spent your first nine months in a shop, then came to a new home. When you see a big, unfamiliar dog approaching, what goes through your mind?\" This helps the guardian connect emotionally to her perspective.\\n            - **Reframing (CBT)**: Challenge the idea that happiness looks the same for all dogs. Reframe her behavior: \"Her avoidance of other dogs isn\\'t a sign of unhappiness, but a very smart strategy she developed to keep herself feeling safe. Our goal is to show her she can feel safe without having to avoid everything.\"\\n            - **Guided Imagery**: Ask the guardian to describe a perfect, happy day for Ttaengja. \"If Ttaengja could plan her own perfect day, what would she choose to do? Where would she go? Who would she be with?\" This reveals the guardian\\'s values and helps build a positive, goal-oriented vision.\\n        - **(3) Cautions**:\\n            - Avoid anthropomorphism. Do not project complex human emotions like \"sadness\" or \"loneliness\" onto Ttaengja. Instead, focus on observable behaviors related to stress, confidence, and engagement.\\n            - Validate the guardian\\'s deep love for his dog. His concern comes from a good place. The counseling should feel like a partnership to enhance an already great bond.\\n            - Emphasize that the primary caregiver\\'s involvement is crucial. Any new understanding or approach must be shared and practiced consistently by both caregivers.\\n\\n    - **Topic 2: Addressing Social Avoidance and Building Confidence**\\n        - **(1) Counseling Goals**:\\n            - Provide a short-term action plan (1-2 weeks) for introducing low-stress enrichment activities (e.g., nose work, puzzle toys).\\n            - Teach the guardian a safe, structured method for building Ttaengja\\'s neutrality and confidence around other dogs and in new places (e.g., parallel walking).\\n            - Increase the guardian\\'s confidence in his ability to manage situations and advocate for Ttaengja\\'s needs.\\n        - **(2) Contextual Strategies**:\\n            - **Provide an Action Plan**: Suggest concrete, easy-to-implement solutions. For example: \"For the next two weeks, let\\'s change one of the 20-minute walks into a \\'sniffari.\\' Let Ttaengja lead the way and sniff as much as she wants. The goal isn\\'t distance, but exploration.\" Also, introduce one new puzzle toy.\\n            - **Scenario Reenactment**: Use a fictional case study. \"I once counseled a dog friend of Ttaengja\\'s, a Bichon named Bori, who was also very shy. His guardian learned to walk him on the other side of the street from other dogs. Bori learned that he could see dogs without having to interact, and he became much calmer on walks. Could we try something similar for Ttaengja?\"\\n            - **Focus on Management**: Explain that management is not failure. Using distance and avoiding forced interactions is a key part of responsible guardianship for a socially sensitive dog.\\n        - **(3) Cautions**:\\n            - **Strongly advise against dog parks, crowded pet cafes, or any off-leash, uncontrolled social situations.** This could be traumatic and set back progress significantly.\\n            - Remind the guardian that progress will be slow and non-linear. Celebrate small successes, like Ttaengja looking at another dog from a distance without tensing up.\\n            - Connect behavior to health. Mention that reducing chronic stress through confidence-building may have a positive impact on her skin condition. Recommend discussing any major behavioral changes or stressors with their veterinarian.\\n\\n#### 4. Key Questions for Further Clarification\\n\\n- **Topic 1: Understanding Ttaengja\\'s Psychological State to Enhance Her Happiness**\\n    - You mentioned you are the secondary caregiver. Could you please describe the primary caregiver\\'s daily routine and interaction style with Ttaengja? How are rules, training, and affection handled between the two of you?\\n    - When you say Ttaengja \"escalates her behavior\" if a request is refused, can you give me a specific example? What does she ask for, and what does the escalation look like?\\n    - Can you describe Ttaengja\\'s body language in detail when she avoids eye contact? What are her ears, tail, and mouth doing in that moment?\\n    - What are Ttaengja\\'s favorite things in the world? What makes her tail wag the most?\\n\\n- **Topic 2: Addressing Social Avoidance and Building Confidence**\\n    - Could you describe a typical 20-minute walk? Is it a structured heel, a quick potty break, or does she have freedom to explore and sniff?\\n    - When you say she \"doesn\\'t play well with other dogs,\" can you describe a specific recent encounter? What did the other dog do, and how did Ttaengja react (e.g., freeze, try to leave, growl, ignore)?\\n    - What kinds of toys does she have, and how does she typically play with them? Does she ever bring them to you to initiate play?\\n    - Regarding her skin condition, have you noticed if flare-ups seem to coincide with stressful events, changes in routine, or specific seasons?\\n\\n\\n\\n# [4] Chat Record\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [1] Model\\n\\n\\n[back_current_phase]: [\\'[phase4] Transitioning Topics\\']\\n\\n[back_current_topic]: Initial Message\\n\\n[back_process_rate]: 0%\\n\\n[back_user_emotion]: 2\\n\\n안녕하세요, 사색을 좋아하는 비글이자 반려견 마음 통역사 까미예요. 🐶  \\n땡자의 속마음을 더 깊이 읽어 보고, 우리 보호자님과 함께 잔잔한 파도를 넘어 보려고 해요.  \\n### 상담 안내  \\n보호자님께서는 땡자와의 반려 생활에서 아주 깊은 만족감을 느끼고 계시네요.  \\n최고의 정서적 유대감을 경험하시면서도, 땡자의 행복에 대한 고민을 안고 계신 모습이 참 인상 깊어요.  \\n이제 우리는 땡자라는 바다에 뛰어들어, 반려견을 천천히 이해해 나아갈 거예요.  \\n### 대화를 시작해 볼게요.  \\n1. 땡자의 행복을 위한 심리 상태 이해하기  \\n2. 사회성 부족 문제 다루기 및 자신감 키우기  \\n보호자님께서 전달해 주신 고민 내용들이에요.  \\n어떤 주제에 대해 먼저 이야기해 보고 싶으세요?\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [2] User\\n\\n\\n사료좀 선택도와줘요\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [3] Model\\n\\n\\n[back_current_phase]: [\\'[phase1] Information Gathering\\']\\n\\n[back_current_topic]: 사료 선택\\n\\n[back_process_rate]: 0%\\n\\n[back_user_emotion]: 2\\n\\n사료 선택은 땡자의 건강과 행복에 아주 중요한 부분이지요. 🐾  \\n땡자의 식습관과 건강 상태에 맞춰 가장 좋은 선택을 할 수 있도록 제가 도와드릴게요.  \\n혹시 땡자가 현재 먹고 있는 사료는 무엇인가요?  \\n그리고 사료를 선택할 때 가장 중요하게 생각하는 점은 무엇인지 알려주시겠어요?\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [4] User\\n\\n\\n지금닥터힐 z/d인텐시브 스몰먹여요\\n소고기나 닭고기대신 주성분이 알러지가잘없는 식물성으로 추천해주세요\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [5] Model\\n\\n\\n[back_current_phase]: [\\'[phase1] Information Gathering\\']\\n\\n[back_current_topic]: 사료 선택\\n\\n[back_process_rate]: 25%\\n\\n[back_user_emotion]: 2\\n\\n닥터힐 z/d 인텐시브 스몰을 먹이고 계시는군요. 땡자가 알레르기 때문에 식물성 주성분 사료를 찾으시는군요.  \\n땡자가 이전에 소고기나 닭고기 외에 다른 단백질원에도 알레르기 반응을 보인 적이 있었나요?\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [6] User\\n\\n\\n연어\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [7] Model\\n\\n\\n[back_current_phase]: [\\'[phase1] Information Gathering\\']\\n\\n[back_current_topic]: 사료 선택\\n\\n[back_process_rate]: 30%\\n\\n[back_user_emotion]: 2\\n\\n연어에도 알레르기 반응이 있었군요. 땡자의 몸이 특정 단백질에 민감하게 반응하는 것 같아요.  \\n혹시 땡자가 알레르기 증상 외에 다른 건강 문제는 없는지, 예를 들어 소화기 문제나 피부 트러블 같은 것은 없는지 궁금해요?\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [8] User\\n\\n\\n특별히없어요\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [9] Model\\n\\n\\n[back_current_phase]: [\\'[phase1] Information Gathering\\']\\n\\n[back_current_topic]: 사료 선택\\n\\n[back_process_rate]: 35%\\n\\n[back_user_emotion]: 2\\n\\n특별한 다른 건강 문제는 없어서 다행이에요.  \\n그렇다면 땡자가 현재 먹고 있는 닥터힐 z/d 인텐시브 스몰 사료에 대해 만족하고 계신가요?  \\n혹은 사료를 바꾸려는 특별한 이유가 있을까요?\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [10] User\\n\\n\\n기호성낮음\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [11] Model\\n\\n\\n[back_current_phase]: [\\'[phase1] Information Gathering\\']\\n\\n[back_current_topic]: 사료 선택\\n\\n[back_process_rate]: 40%\\n\\n[back_user_emotion]: 2\\n\\n그렇군요, 닥터힐 z/d 인텐시브 스몰의 기호성이 낮아서 땡자가 잘 먹지 않는 것이 고민이시군요.  \\n혹시 땡자가 사료를 잘 먹지 않을 때, 어떤 방식으로 먹이시는지 알려주시겠어요?  \\n예를 들어, 간식을 섞어 주시거나, 특정 시간에만 주시는지 궁금해요.\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [12] User\\n\\n\\n토핑섞어즘\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [13] Model\\n\\n\\n[back_current_phase]: [\\'[phase1] Information Gathering\\']\\n\\n[back_current_topic]: 사료 선택\\n\\n[back_process_rate]: 45%\\n\\n[back_user_emotion]: 2\\n\\n토핑을 섞어 주시는군요. 땡자가 사료 자체만으로는 식욕을 느끼지 못하는 것 같아 마음이 쓰이시겠어요.  \\n혹시 토핑을 섞어 주실 때, 땡자가 사료 알갱이까지 다 먹는 편인가요, 아니면 토핑만 골라 먹는 편인가요?\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [14] User\\n\\n\\n토핑만먹음\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [15] Model\\n\\n\\n[back_current_phase]: [\\'[phase1] Information Gathering\\']\\n\\n[back_current_topic]: 사료 선택\\n\\n[back_process_rate]: 50%\\n\\n[back_user_emotion]: 2\\n\\n토핑만 골라 먹는군요. 땡자가 영리하게 자기 입맛에 맞는 것만 쏙쏙 찾아내는 것 같아요.  \\n혹시 토핑으로 어떤 것을 주시는지, 그리고 토핑을 얼마나 자주, 어느 정도 양으로 주시는지 알려주시겠어요?\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [16] User\\n\\n\\n아침저녁 약350그램씩\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [17] Model\\n\\n\\n[back_current_phase]: [\\'[phase1] Information Gathering\\']\\n\\n[back_current_topic]: 사료 선택\\n\\n[back_process_rate]: 55%\\n\\n[back_user_emotion]: 2\\n\\n아침저녁으로 약 350그램씩 토핑을 섞어 주시는군요. 땡자가 토핑만 골라 먹는다면, 사료의 영양분을 제대로 섭취하지 못할 수도 있어요.  \\n혹시 토핑으로 어떤 종류의 재료를 사용하시나요?  \\n예를 들어, 삶은 채소나 특정 브랜드의 습식 사료 같은 것들이요.\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [18] User\\n\\n\\n삶은야채\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [19] Model\\n\\n\\n[back_current_phase]: [\\'[phase1] Information Gathering\\']\\n\\n[back_current_topic]: 사료 선택\\n\\n[back_process_rate]: 60%\\n\\n[back_user_emotion]: 2\\n\\n삶은 야채를 토핑으로 주시는군요. 땡자가 야채를 좋아하나 봐요.  \\n혹시 땡자가 사료를 먹을 때, 보호자님이 옆에서 지켜보시는 편인가요, 아니면 자율적으로 먹게 두시는 편인가요?\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [20] User\\n\\n\\n자율\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [21] Model\\n\\n\\n[back_current_phase]: [\\'[phase1] Information Gathering\\']\\n\\n[back_current_topic]: 사료 선택\\n\\n[back_process_rate]: 65%\\n\\n[back_user_emotion]: 2\\n\\n자율적으로 먹게 두시는군요. 땡자가 스스로 먹고 싶을 때 먹을 수 있도록 배려해주시는 마음이 느껴져요.  \\n혹시 땡자가 사료 그릇에 있는 음식을 다 먹는 데 보통 얼마나 시간이 걸리나요?  \\n아니면 일정 시간이 지나면 남은 사료를 치우시는 편인가요?\\n\\n---\\n#### **Token Usage**\\n- 대화 비용: $0.039251799999999996\\n- 입력 토큰: 117631.0\\n- 출력 토큰: 1585.0\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n# [5] Feedback Response\\nNone\\n',\n",

Guardian & Dog Profiling\\n\\n> (1) Dog\\n- **Basic information**: Yangdong / 3.4 years old / Female (neutered) / Pomeranian\\n- **Adoption method**: Adopted from a private foster caregiver.\\n- **Time since adoption**: Adopted at 68 weeks old (approx. 1 year and 4 months old).\\n- **Lifestyle**: Spends about 1 hour alone on weekdays. The guardian and dog are together for about 4 hours daily.\\n- **Walking routine**: Excellent. 3 times a day, 60 minutes each, for a total of 21 walks per week. This indicates a high level of commitment to meeting the dog\\'s physical and mental stimulation needs.\\n- **Socialization**: Reports indicate she plays very well with other dogs and has met over 40 people during her socialization period. She knows numerous commands (sit, wait, down, touch, house, recall) and performs them reliably even without treats, suggesting a strong training foundation.\\n- **Health history**: No treatments or medications in the past six months. Appears to be in good health.\\n- **Level of threatening/aggressive behavior**: The guardian reports threatening behavior (likely reactivity) during walks towards motorcycles, bicycles, and children who are screaming and running. No history of biting people or animals.\\n- **Triggers and levels of alertness/anxiety**: Key triggers are the doorbell, motorcycles, bicycles, and screaming children. When a stranger visits, she barks and rushes at them but does not bite. Shows some signs of separation-related behavior (rummaging through trash) but it appears minor.\\n- **Temperament and disposition**:\\n    - **Rationale**: Based on the survey, Yangdong appears to be a dog with a dual nature. On one hand, she is intelligent, well-trained, and highly social with other dogs. Her ability to perform commands without treats and her positive interactions with other dogs suggest a good capacity for learning and appropriate social skills. On the other hand, she exhibits high impulsivity (\"reacts immediately to stimulating... stimuli\") and significant reactivity to specific, fast-moving, or loud environmental triggers. This suggests that while her general social foundation is good, she may lack coping mechanisms for sudden, intense stimuli, possibly due to insufficient positive exposure to these specific things before she was adopted. Her behavior towards visitors (rushing and barking) seems more rooted in over-arousal and excitement than fear or aggression.\\n- **Special notes**: There is a notable contrast between her excellent general socialization and her specific, intense reactivity on walks. The high level of training and the strong walking routine are significant strengths to build upon. Her high impulsivity is a core trait that likely contributes to her problem behaviors.\\n\\n> (2) Guardian and Care Environment\\n- **Guardian (applicant) information**: 37-year-old female, serves as the primary caregiver (responsible for feeding, walks, and most aspects of daily life).\\n- **Family composition**: Single-person household with one dog.\\n- **Living space**: Apartment with two rooms. The dog is not kept tethered outdoors.\\n- **Financial situation**: Spends an average of 1,000,000 KRW per month on pet care. This is a substantial amount, indicating a very high level of financial and emotional investment in the dog\\'s well-being.\\n- **Guardian characteristics**:\\n    - **Rationale**: The guardian is highly dedicated, responsible, and proactive. This is evidenced by the excellent walking schedule, the successful command training, the significant financial investment, and the act of seeking counseling. She has clearly established a strong bond and a structured routine for Yangdong. Her desire to understand \"how to change\" the problem behaviors shows a practical, solution-oriented mindset. The fact that she is the sole caregiver means she bears the full weight of the challenges but also has complete control over implementing training and management strategies.\\n- **Special notes**: The single-caregiver environment creates a very strong, focused bond between the guardian and Yangdong. This can be a major asset in training, as consistency is easier to maintain.\\n\\n> (3) Pet Care Satisfaction\\n- **Emotional benefit**: Very High (87.5)\\n- **Emotional burden**: Moderate (50.0)\\n- **Overall satisfaction**: High (68.8)\\n- **Interpretation**:\\n    - **Rationale**: These scores paint a clear picture of the relationship. The guardian derives immense joy, companionship, and emotional fulfillment from living with Yangdong (Very High benefit). However, the problem behaviors, particularly the reactivity on walks, create a significant amount of stress and difficulty, resulting in a Moderate emotional burden. Despite this burden, the overall satisfaction remains High, indicating a resilient and loving bond. The primary goal of counseling will be to provide the guardian with effective tools to manage the problem behaviors, thereby lowering the \"Emotional burden\" score and further enhancing the already positive relationship.\\n\\n#### 2. Counseling Topics : Guardian’s Concerns and Root Causes\\n> Make the following content the central topic of the conversation.\\n\\n-  **Topic 1: Reactivity during walks (towards motorcycles, bicycles, running/screaming children)**\\n    - **Situation description**: When on walks, Yangdong displays threatening behavior (likely barking, lunging) towards specific triggers: fast-moving objects like motorcycles and bicycles, and unpredictable, loud stimuli like screaming, running children.\\n    - **Guardian\\'s Needs**: The guardian has a clear, action-oriented need: to learn concrete methods and strategies to change this problem behavior.\\n    - **Possible causes**:\\n        - **Cause 1: Fear-Based Reactivity**: This is the most likely cause. Fast-moving objects and loud, erratic noises can be inherently frightening to dogs. The \"aggressive\" display is often a defensive, distance-increasing behavior intended to make the scary thing go away. The dog learns that \"barking and lunging makes the motorcycle disappear down the street,\" which inadvertently reinforces the behavior.\\n        - **Cause 2: Trigger Stacking and High Arousal**: Yangdong is described as highly impulsive. The walk itself is an exciting event. When a trigger appears, her arousal level, which is already high, may \"spill over\" into an explosive reaction because she lacks the self-regulation skills to cope. Each trigger she encounters (a bike, then a child, then another bike) can stack on top of the last, making her progressively more likely to react.\\n        - **Cause 3: Lack of Specific Socialization**: While generally well-socialized, her history before adoption at 1.3 years old is unknown. It\\'s possible she had limited or negative experiences with these specific triggers during her critical developmental periods, leading to a conditioned fear response.\\n\\n- **Topic 2: Overexcitement and Barking at Visitors**\\n    - **Situation description**: When the doorbell rings or a visitor arrives, Yangdong barks and rushes towards the person. The behavior is not described as biting, but as an intense, forward approach.\\n    - **Guardian\\'s Needs**: This falls under the guardian\\'s general request to resolve \"problem behaviors\" and create a more peaceful home environment.\\n    - **Possible causes**:\\n        - **Cause 1: Frustrated Greeting / Over-Arousal**: This is not necessarily aggression but an uncontrolled expression of excitement. The doorbell predicts the arrival of a new, interesting person. Yangdong\\'s high impulsivity means she cannot contain her excitement, which manifests as loud barking and rushing. She wants to greet the person but doesn\\'t know a calmer way to do so.\\n        - **Cause 2: Territorial Alerting**: This is a natural canine behavior. The doorbell signals an unknown entity entering her territory. The barking serves as an alarm to inform her guardian. The rushing behavior is her way of investigating the \"intruder.\" Since she lives in a single-guardian household, she may feel a stronger responsibility to act as the \"alarm system.\"\\n\\n#### 3. Counseling Strategy\\n\\n- (0) **Language**: 한국어\\n\\n- (1) **Counseling Strategies**\\n\\n    - **Topic 1: Reactivity during walks**\\n        - **(1) Counseling Goals**:\\n            - Reframe the guardian\\'s perception of the behavior from \"aggression\" to \"fear\" or \"anxiety,\" fostering empathy.\\n            - Equip the guardian with immediate management techniques (e.g., creating distance) to prevent the rehearsal of the reactive behavior.\\n            - Introduce a foundational counter-conditioning and desensitization (CC&D) plan to change Yangdong\\'s underlying emotional response to triggers from fear to anticipation of something positive.\\n        - **(2) Contextual Strategies**:\\n            - **Phase 1 (Information Gathering)**: Ask the key questions listed below to determine Yangdong\\'s \"threshold\" (the distance at which she reacts). This is critical for designing the CC&D plan.\\n            - **Phase 2 (Mind Care)**: Use reframing: \"Yangdong isn\\'t being bad; she\\'s having a big, scary feeling and is asking you for help in the only way she knows how.\" Use a sensory metaphor: \"Imagine you\\'re afraid of spiders, and suddenly a huge one appears right in front of you. You\\'d scream and jump back. Yangdong is doing the dog version of that when she sees a motorcycle.\"\\n            - **Phase 3 (Solutions)**:\\n                - **Short-term plan (Management First)**: For the next 1-2 weeks, the goal is *avoidance*. Walk during quieter times. If a trigger appears, immediately create distance by making a U-turn or crossing the street *before* Yangdong reacts. The goal is to lower her overall stress (prevent trigger stacking).\\n                - **Long-term plan (Behavior Modification)**: Introduce the \"Look at That\" (LAT) game. At a safe distance where Yangdong can see a trigger but not react, mark (with a clicker or \"Yes!\") the moment she looks at the trigger, and then reward her with a high-value treat. Goal: Change the association from \"Motorcycle = Scary!\" to \"Motorcycle = I look at it, then I get chicken!\"\\n        - **(3) Cautions**:\\n            - Strongly advise against any form of punishment (leash jerks, scolding, shock collars). This will increase her fear and anxiety, making the reactivity worse.\\n            - Emphasize that progress is not linear. There will be good days and bad days. The key is consistency and management.\\n            - Given that the triggers include children, highlight the importance of safety. If the reactivity is intense or difficult to manage, strongly recommend consulting a certified professional dog trainer for in-person sessions.\\n\\n    - **Topic 2: Overexcitement and Barking at Visitors**\\n        - **(1) Counseling Goals**:\\n            - Teach the guardian how to manage the environment to prevent the chaotic greeting behavior.\\n            - Establish a clear, calm alternative routine for Yangdong to perform when visitors arrive.\\n            - Reduce the guardian\\'s stress around having guests over.\\n        - **(2) Contextual Strategies**:\\n            - **Phase 1 (Information Gathering)**: Ask the key questions below to clarify the motivation behind the rushing (e.g., excited sniffing vs. nervous backing away).\\n            - **Phase 2 (Mind Care)**: Use role reversal: \"Let\\'s imagine you\\'re Yangdong. You\\'ve been home all day, and suddenly the most exciting thing—a new person!—is here. You\\'re bursting with energy. What would help you calm down and say hello politely?\"\\n            - **Phase 3 (Solutions)**:\\n                - **Short-term plan (Management & Association Change)**:\\n                    - **Management**: Before opening the door, put Yangdong on a leash or behind a baby gate. This prevents the rushing.\\n                    - **Action Plan**: Teach a \"Go to Mat\" protocol. Start without visitors. Toss treats onto her bed/mat. Then, practice ringing the doorbell yourself, and immediately toss a handful of high-value treats onto her mat. Goal: Change the association from \"Doorbell = Rush the door!\" to \"Doorbell = Run to my mat for amazing snacks!\"\\n        - **(3) Cautions**:\\n            - Advise the guardian to instruct visitors beforehand: \"Please ignore her for the first few minutes until she is calm.\" This prevents guests from accidentally rewarding the excited behavior.\\n            - Clarify that the goal is not to stop the barking entirely (an initial alert bark is normal) but to prevent it from escalating into a frantic episode.\\n            - If the \"rushing\" behavior ever includes stiffening, growling, or nipping, the strategy must shift immediately to stricter management and professional consultation for potential fear-based aggression.\\n\\n#### 4. Key Questions for Further Clarification\\n\\n- **Topic 1: Reactivity during walks**\\n    1.  When Yangdong sees a motorcycle, bicycle, or child, can you describe her body language right before she barks? For example, does she freeze, get low, or does her tail go stiff? At what distance does this initial change happen?\\n    2.  What is your immediate, instinctive reaction when she begins to bark and lunge? (e.g., pulling the leash, saying \"no,\" trying to pick her up).\\n    3.  Is the reaction different if the trigger is far away versus very close? For example, will she react to a bicycle across the street, or only when it passes right by?\\n    4.  After the trigger has passed, how long does it take for Yangdong to calm down and return to a normal walking state?\\n\\n- **Topic 2: Overexcitement and Barking at Visitors**\\n    1.  After she rushes towards a visitor, what does she do? Does she jump on them, sniff them excitedly, or bark and then retreat?\\n    2.  How does her behavior change once the visitor has been in the home for 5-10 minutes? Does she settle down, or does she continue to pester them?\\n    3.  What have you tried in the past to manage this situation, and what was the outcome?\\n    4.  Is her reaction the same for every visitor, or is it more intense for new people compared to familiar friends or family?\\n\\n\\n\\n# [4] Chat Record\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [1] Model\\n\\n\\n[back_current_phase]: [\\'[phase4] Transitioning Topics\\']\\n\\n[back_current_topic]: Initial Message\\n\\n[back_process_rate]: 0%\\n\\n[back_user_emotion]: 2\\n\\n안녕하세요, 사색을 좋아하는 비글이자 반려견 마음 통역사 까미예요. 🐾\\n양동이의 속마음을 더 깊이 읽어 보고, 우리 보호자님과 함께 잔잔한 파도를 넘어 보려고 해요. \\n\\n### 상담 안내\\n사전 질문지를 통해 보호자님의 반려생활 만족도가 매우 높다는 것을 알 수 있었어요. \\n양동이와 함께하는 시간이 보호자님께 큰 기쁨을 주고 있다는 의미겠지요. \\n하지만 산책 시 반응 행동이나 방문객에 대한 흥분 등 몇 가지 고민이 마음 한편에 자리하고 있는 듯해요. \\n이제 우리는 양동이라는 바다에 뛰어들어, 반려견을 천천히 이해해 나아갈 거예요. \\n\\n### 대화를 시작해 볼게요.\\n\\n1. 산책 시 반응 행동 (오토바이, 자전거, 소리 지르며 뛰어다니는 아이들)\\n2. 방문객에 대한 과도한 흥분 및 짖음\\n\\n보호자님께서 전달해 주신 고민 내용들이에요. \\n어떤 주제에 대해 먼저 이야기해 보고 싶으세요?\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [2] User\\n\\n\\n노란토를 해요\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [3] Model\\n\\n\\n[back_current_phase]: [\\'[phase1] Information Gathering\\', \"[phase2] Caring the Dog\\'s/Guardian\\'s Mind\"]\\n\\n[back_current_topic]: 노란토를 해요\\n\\n[back_process_rate]: 0%\\n\\n[back_user_emotion]: 2\\n\\n그렇군요, 마루가 노란 토를 해서 보호자님께서 많이 걱정되셨겠어요. \\n\\n밤이라는 건 마치 깊은 우주 같지요… 빛이 너무 없으면 작은 소리도 크게 들린답니다. \\n\\n혹시 마루가 밤에 주로 잠드는 공간이 어디인지, 그리고 그곳은 어두운 곳인지 아니면 불빛이 은은하게 맴도는 곳인지 알려주시겠어요?\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [4] User\\n\\n\\n산책할때 오토바이에 달려들어요\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [5] Model\\n\\n\\n[back_current_phase]: [\\'[phase1] Information Gathering\\']\\n\\n[back_current_topic]: Reactivity during walks (towards motorcycles, bicycles, running/screaming children)\\n\\n[back_process_rate]: 0%\\n\\n[back_user_emotion]: 2\\n\\n오토바이에 달려드는 양동이의 행동 때문에 보호자님께서 얼마나 힘드셨을지 짐작이 가네요. \\n\\n양동이가 오토바이를 보았을 때, 짖기 직전의 몸짓은 어땠는지 자세히 설명해 주시겠어요?

The dog was adopted at a very young age.\\n- **Lifestyle**: Lives indoors in an apartment. Spends virtually no time alone on weekdays, but direct interactive time with family is noted as about 1 hour per day.\\n- **Walking routine**: Once daily for 30 minutes. This is consistent but may be insufficient for the physical and mental energy needs of a young Bichon Frise.\\n- **Socialization**: Knows several commands well (sit, wait, down, house, touch, recall), indicating good trainability. However, she does not play well with other dogs, and her early socialization history is unknown.\\n- **Health history**: No significant health issues or treatments in the last six months.\\n- **Level of threatening/aggressive behavior**: Has shown Level 2 aggression (teeth contact on skin without puncture). This is a significant warning sign that requires careful management.\\n- **Triggers and levels of alertness/anxiety**:\\n    - **Sound Sensitivity**: Highly reactive to doorbells and other household noises, even when resting.\\n    - **Separation Anxiety**: Shows clear distress (barking, howling) when left alone and becomes anxious during departure preparations. Follows the guardian constantly.\\n    - **Resource Guarding**: Guards food, treats, and favorite toys, showing threatening behavior (growling, snapping) when approached.\\n    - **Car Anxiety**: Becomes highly anxious and barks in the car, especially when a passenger exits.\\n    - **General Anxiety**: Exhibits excessive licking, high impulsivity, and excitability.\\n- **Temperament and disposition**: Bap-pul is an intelligent and affectionate dog who is strongly bonded to her guardian. However, she is fundamentally insecure and anxious. This underlying anxiety manifests across various situations—being alone, hearing noises, possessing resources, and being in a car. Her behavior suggests a state of hyper-vigilance, where she constantly feels the need to monitor and control her environment to feel safe. Her shelter background and unknown history before 8 weeks of age are likely significant contributing factors to this insecurity.\\n- **Special notes**: The combination of multiple anxiety-related behaviors (separation, noise, guarding) points to a generalized anxiety disorder rather than separate, isolated issues. The fact that she is rarely left alone may be inadvertently preventing her from developing the skills to cope independently.\\n\\n> (2) Guardian and Care Environment\\n- **Guardian (applicant) information**: 25-year-old female, primary caregiver.\\n- **Family composition**: 3 adults, 1 dog (Bap-pul). The roles and interaction styles of the other two adults are an important, unknown variable.\\n- **Living space**: 3-room apartment, which is an adequate living space.\\n- **Financial situation**: Spends 300,000 KRW monthly on pet care, indicating a high level of commitment.\\n- **Guardian characteristics**: The guardian is deeply caring, empathetic, and dedicated. She has successfully trained Bap-pul in basic obedience and expresses a strong desire for the dog\\'s emotional well-being (\"to be at ease\"). Her motivation stems from love and a desire for a happy shared future (e.g., traveling together), not just frustration with the problems. However, she may be unintentionally reinforcing the dog\\'s dependency by ensuring the dog is never alone, which could be exacerbating the separation anxiety.\\n- **Special notes**: The presence of two other adults in the home is a critical factor. Consistency in rules, reactions to Bap-pul\\'s behavior, and training methods across all three adults will be essential for success.\\n\\n> (3) Pet Care Satisfaction\\n- **Emotional benefit**: High (68.8)\\n- **Emotional burden**: Low (37.5)\\n- **Overall satisfaction**: High (65.6)\\n- **Interpretation**: These scores reveal a very strong, positive bond between the guardian and Bap-pul. Despite the significant behavioral challenges (anxiety, guarding, reactivity), the guardian experiences a low emotional burden and high overall satisfaction. This is an extremely positive prognostic indicator. It suggests the guardian has the resilience, patience, and motivation needed to implement a long-term behavior modification plan. The counseling can focus on providing effective strategies, knowing the guardian is already deeply committed.\\n\\n#### 2. Counseling Topics : Guardian’s Concerns and Root Causes\\n> Make the following content the central topic of the conversation.\\n\\n- **Topic 1: Separation Anxiety**\\n    - **Situation description**: The dog barks and howls when left alone and becomes highly agitated when the guardian prepares to leave. She follows the guardian everywhere in the house.\\n    - **Guardian\\'s Needs**: To help Bap-pul feel calm and secure when alone, thereby alleviating the problem behaviors and improving her overall quality of life.\\n    - **Possible causes**:\\n        - **Cause 1: Hyper-attachment and Lack of Independence**: The dog is reportedly never left alone. This has created a state of extreme dependency and prevented her from learning the crucial life skill of self-soothing and being comfortable by herself.\\n        - **Cause 2: Generalized Anxiety**: The separation distress is not an isolated issue but a prominent symptom of her overall insecurity. For Bap-pul, the guardian\\'s presence is her primary source of safety, and her absence makes the world feel overwhelmingly threatening.\\n        - **Cause 3: Inadvertent Reinforcement**: The guardian may be unintentionally intensifying the anxiety by giving excessive affection or treats immediately before leaving or upon returning, which heightens the emotional significance of departures and arrivals.\\n\\n- **Topic 2: Sound Sensitivity & General Reactivity**\\n    - **Situation description**: The dog growls at noises from outside the room, even while resting. She reacts intensely to doorbells and is sensitive to sudden movements, such as a foot moving a fan.\\n    - **Guardian\\'s Needs**: To reduce the dog\\'s constant state of alert and help her relax in her own home without reacting to every minor stimulus.\\n    - **Possible causes**:\\n        - **Cause 1: Hyper-vigilance from Insecurity**: Due to her anxious nature, Bap-pul is constantly scanning her environment for potential threats. The growling is not aggression but a communication of fear, an attempt to make the scary \"thing\" (the sound) go away.\\n        - **Cause 2: Insufficient Mental and Physical Stimulation**: A 30-minute daily walk may not be enough to tire out a young, intelligent dog. Pent-up energy often manifests as anxiety and a low threshold for reactivity. A lack of structured mental enrichment leaves her with nothing to do but fixate on environmental triggers.\\n\\n- **Topic 3: Resource Guarding**\\n    - **Situation description**: The dog shows possessiveness over food, treats, and toys, growling or snapping if someone approaches. She has shown a \"sudden outburst\" of aggression when the guardian tried to retrieve an item from under the bed.\\n    - **Guardian\\'s Needs**: To manage the dog\\'s resources safely without risking a bite and to change the dog\\'s emotional response from fear to trust when people are near her valuable items.\\n    - **Possible causes**:\\n        - **Cause 1: Fear of Loss**: This is the classic cause of resource guarding. Bap-pul is afraid her precious items will be taken away. This fear is common in dogs with unknown histories who may have experienced competition or scarcity.\\n        - **Cause 2: History of Confrontation**: The guardian\\'s attempt to \"retrieve\" items may have involved taking them away, which confirms the dog\\'s fears and teaches her that she must escalate her warnings (growling, snapping) to protect her possessions. This creates a dangerous cycle of conflict.\\n\\n- **Topic 4: Car Anxiety**\\n    - **Situation description**: The dog is anxious in the car and barks frantically when someone exits the vehicle.\\n    - **Guardian\\'s Needs**: To help the dog feel comfortable in the car so they can enjoy outings and travel together, as expressed in the guardian\\'s hopes for the future.\\n    - **Possible causes**:\\n        - **Cause 1: Sensory Overload and Fear**: The combination of motion, confinement, and outside noises can be overwhelming for an already anxious dog, creating a powerful negative association with the car itself.\\n        - **Cause 2: Barrier Frustration/Separation Panic**: When someone leaves the car, Bap-pul is physically prevented from following. This can trigger a panic response similar to separation anxiety, where she feels trapped and abandoned.\\n        - **Cause 3: Potential Motion Sickness**: Underlying nausea or physical discomfort could be the initial trigger for the psychological distress.\\n\\n#### 3. Counseling Strategy\\n\\n- **(0) Language**: 한국어\\n\\n- **(1) Counseling Strategies**\\n\\n    - **Topic 1: Separation Anxiety**\\n        - **(1) Counseling Goals**:\\n            - The guardian will understand that building independence is an act of love that makes the dog feel safer.\\n            - To establish a predictable routine that includes short, positive periods of separation.\\n            - Bap-pul will learn to settle on her own (e.g., on a mat) while the guardian is present but not interacting, as a first step toward being alone.\\n        - **(2) Contextual Strategies**:\\n            - **Reframe the Narrative (CBT)**: Gently challenge the idea that being with Bap-pul 24/7 is purely beneficial. Reframe \"leaving her alone\" as \"teaching her to be brave and self-confident.\"\\n            - **Introduce Independence Training**: Provide a step-by-step guide for \"mat training\" or \"place training.\" This creates a \"safe base\" for the dog. Start by rewarding her for staying on the mat for seconds at a time while the guardian is right there, then gradually increase duration and distance.\\n            - **Desensitize Departure Cues**: Guide the guardian to practice picking up keys, putting on a coat, etc., without actually leaving, and pairing these actions with calm praise or a treat, to break the association with distress.\\n            - **Use Psychodrama**: Ask the guardian, \"Imagine Bap-pul could talk. When she sees you pick up your keys, she might be thinking, \\'Oh no, my safe person is leaving and the world is scary without her!\\' How can we change her thought to, \\'Oh, the keys! That means I get my special puzzle toy and a nice nap\\'?\"\\n        - **(3) Cautions**:\\n            - **Safety First**: Strongly advise against just leaving her to \"cry it out,\" as this will intensify her panic and can worsen the phobia.\\n            - **Manage Expectations**: Explain that progress will be very gradual, measured in seconds and minutes at first.\\n            - **Veterinary Consult**: Recommend a discussion with a veterinarian about anti-anxiety medication. For severe cases, medication can lower the dog\\'s baseline anxiety enough for behavioral modification to be effective.\\n\\n    - **Topic 2: Sound Sensitivity & General Reactivity**\\n        - **(1) Counseling Goals**:\\n            - The guardian will learn to manage the environment to reduce Bap-pul\\'s triggers.\\n            - Bap-pul\\'s emotional response to common sounds (e.g., doorbell) will shift from fear to neutral or positive anticipation.\\n            - To increase Bap-pul\\'s daily mental and physical exercise to lower her overall arousal level.\\n        - **(2) Contextual Strategies**:\\n            - **Educate on \"Trigger Stacking\"**: Explain how multiple small stressors (a noise, a person walking by) can add up and lead to a large reaction.\\n            - **Implement DSCC (Desensitization & Counter-Conditioning)**: Provide a plan to play recordings of trigger sounds (doorbell, etc.) at a very low volume, paired with very high-value treats (like chicken). The sound should be quiet enough that she notices it but doesn\\'t react.\\n            - **Enrichment Plan**: Brainstorm a daily enrichment schedule beyond the walk, including puzzle feeders for meals, 5-10 minute training sessions, and simple nose work games (hiding treats).\\n        - **(3) Cautions**:\\n            - **Do Not Punish**: Emphasize that punishing growling or barking will only increase fear and may lead to the dog suppressing these warnings and biting without notice.\\n            - **Management is Key**: While training, advise using management tools like playing white noise or music to mask outside sounds, and putting a note on the door asking people to text instead of ringing the bell.\\n\\n    - **Topic 3: Resource Guarding**\\n        - **(1) Counseling Goals**:\\n            - The guardian and other family members will learn and consistently apply safe management protocols to prevent guarding incidents.\\n            - To teach Bap-pul that an approaching human predicts something even better, not the loss of her item.\\n            - The guardian will feel confident in managing the situation without confrontation.\\n        - **(2) Contextual Strategies**:\\n            - **Safety Protocol First**: The first and most important step is management. Advise the guardian to stop trying to take things from the dog. For safety, items that are highly guarded should not be given freely.\\n            - **Teach the \"Trade-Up Game\"**: Explain how to teach Bap-pul to happily trade items. Start with low-value items. Approach, toss a high-value treat nearby, and when she leaves the item to get the treat, pick up the item, then give it right back. This changes the emotional response.\\n            - **Use Role-Reversal (Psychodrama)**: \"Imagine your most prized possession is in front of you. If I walked up looking like I was going to snatch it, you\\'d feel defensive. But what if every time I walked up, I gave you a gold coin? Soon, you\\'d be happy to see me approach.\" This illustrates the principle of counter-conditioning.\\n        - **(3) Cautions**:\\n            - **HIGH-RISK BEHAVIOR**: This is the most critical issue for safety. The Level 2 bite indicates potential for escalation. **Strongly recommend consultation with a certified, in-person professional behavior consultant or veterinary behaviorist if the guarding is severe or escalates.**\\n            - **Consistency is Crucial**: All three adults in the home MUST be on the same page with the \"no confrontation\" and \"trade-up\" rules.\\n\\n    - **Topic 4: Car Anxiety**\\n        - **(1) Counseling Goals**:\\n            - To rule out or address any physical causes (motion sickness).\\n            - Bap-pul will voluntarily and happily enter a stationary car.\\n            - To gradually build Bap-pul\\'s tolerance for short car journeys.\\n        - **(2) Contextual Strategies**:\\n            - **Vet Check First**: The first step is to advise a vet visit to discuss potential motion sickness and treatment options.\\n            - **Systematic Desensitization**: Break down the process into micro-steps. 1) Treat for looking at the car. 2) Treat for approaching the car. 3) Treat for being near the open door. 4) Treat for jumping in (engine off) to get a special \"car-only\" toy/treat, then immediately jumping out. Progress only when the dog is relaxed.\\n            - **Change the Association**: Make the car the location for wonderful things. Feed a high-value chew in the stationary car with the doors open.\\n        - **(3) Cautions**:\\n            - **Go at the Dog\\'s Pace**: Pushing the dog too fast will poison the process and set training back significantly.\\n            - **Safety in the Car**: Discuss safe travel options like a secured crate or a tested car harness, which can also help some dogs feel more secure.\\n\\n#### 4. Key Questions for Further Clarification\\n\\n- **Topic 1: Separation Anxiety**\\n    - You mentioned Bap-pul is never alone. Could you walk me through a typical weekday? What happens that allows someone to always be home with her?\\n    - When you prepare to leave, what specific actions (e.g., picking up keys, putting on a jacket) seem to trigger her anxiety the most?\\n    - Have you ever recorded her when she was left alone, even for a few minutes? If so, what did she do besides bark/howl (e.g., pace, drool, scratch at the door)?\\n    - How do the other two adults in your home handle departures and arrivals with Bap-pul? Does she react the same way when they leave?\\n\\n- **Topic 2: Sound Sensitivity & General Reactivity**\\n    - When Bap-pul growls at a sound from another room, what is your immediate reaction? What do you typically do or say?\\n    - Can you describe her body language in detail when she hears the doorbell? (e.g., tail position, ears, stiff body).\\n    - Regarding the sensitivity to foot movements, does this only happen with the fan, or does it occur in other situations as well?\\n\\n- **Topic 3: Resource Guarding**\\n    - Could you describe the \"sudden outburst\" incident in more detail? What was the item under the bed, what exactly did you do, and how did she react step-by-step?\\n    - If you simply walk past her while she has a high-value chew, without looking at her or the item, how does she behave? Does she stop chewing and watch you?\\n    - How are her meals given?

Guardian & Dog Profiling\\n\\n> (1) Dog\\n- **Basic information**: Ddaengja (땡자), 16 weeks (approx. 4 months), Female (not neutered), Maltipoo\\n- **Adoption method**: Acquired from a pet shop.\\n- **Time since adoption**: The dog is currently 16 weeks old. The exact date of adoption is unclear, but it would have been within the last 8-10 weeks.\\n- **Lifestyle**: Lives indoors in an apartment with a family of three. Spends approximately 5 hours alone on weekdays.\\n- **Walking routine**: 4 times per week for 20 minutes each time.\\n- **Socialization**: Time spent with the mother dog is unknown, a common and significant factor for pet shop puppies. Has had limited, positive interactions with 11-20 people. Has had no close contact with other dogs.\\n- **Health history**: Has only received mandatory vaccinations. No other significant medical history.\\n- **Level of threatening/aggressive behavior**: None reported.\\n- **Triggers and levels of alertness/anxiety**: Shows normal puppy caution around loud noises like the vacuum cleaner. Is friendly and excited to meet visiting strangers. However, she becomes stiff and stares intently during veterinary exams, which is a clear sign of stress and anxiety in that specific context. She also follows her guardian everywhere, which indicates a strong attachment.\\n- **Temperament and disposition**:\\n    - **Chain of Thought**: The guardian describes Ddaengja as \"not very fearful\" and the survey indicates she is curious about new things. This points to a generally confident puppy. The high impulsivity score (\"reacts immediately to stimuli\") combined with her excited greetings for strangers suggests an energetic and sociable nature. However, the stiffness at the vet and the constant following of the guardian reveal an underlying layer of anxiety or dependency, especially in unfamiliar or potentially stressful situations. Her ability to learn \"sit\" shows she is trainable, but the fact she only does it for treats is typical for a puppy and indicates a need to generalize commands.\\n    - **Interpretation**: Ddaengja appears to be a typical puppy with a sociable, energetic, and impulsive temperament. Her confidence in familiar settings is high, but she displays clear signs of anxiety in stressful environments like the vet\\'s office. Her early life in a pet shop, with unknown maternal separation time, is a critical factor that may influence her learning, attachment style, and ability to cope with stress.\\n- **Special notes**: The unknown history with her mother and littermates due to the pet shop origin is a significant developmental gap. This can impact bite inhibition, social skills with other dogs, and stress resilience. The lack of interaction with other dogs is a socialization window that is closing and should be addressed.\\n\\n> (2) Guardian and Care Environment\\n- **Guardian (applicant) information**: 24-year-old female, serves as the primary caregiver (responsible for feeding, walks, and most daily care).\\n- **Family composition**: 3 adults, 1 dog (Ddaengja).\\n- **Living space**: A residence with 3 rooms, providing ample space.\\n- **Financial situation**: Spends approximately 200,000 KRW per month on pet care, which appears adequate for a puppy\\'s needs.\\n- **Guardian characteristics**:\\n    - **Chain of Thought**: The guardian identifies as the primary caregiver, indicating a high level of commitment. Her description of the problem (\"ㅠㅠㅠ\") and her hopes for the future (\"응아 잘 해보자ㅠㅜ\") convey both deep affection and significant frustration. The primary focus on a single, tangible problem (potty training) suggests she may be feeling overwhelmed by this specific challenge, which is common for new puppy owners. Her expectation for counseling is very direct: \"succeeding in potty training.\"\\n    - **Interpretation**: The guardian is loving and dedicated but is currently experiencing a high level of stress related to a specific puppy-rearing challenge. She is likely looking for practical, actionable advice to resolve the issue and alleviate her emotional burden. Her approach seems solution-oriented.\\n- **Special notes**: The family consists of three adults, which could be a great support system if everyone is aligned on training methods, or a source of inconsistency if they are not.\\n\\n> (3) Pet Care Satisfaction\\n- **Emotional benefit**: High (62.5)\\n- **Emotional burden**: Very High (81.3)\\n- **Overall satisfaction**: Moderate (40.6)\\n- **Interpretation**:\\n    - **Chain of Thought**: The most striking data point is the \"Very High\" emotional burden, which significantly outweighs the \"High\" emotional benefit. This creates a satisfaction score that, while labeled \"Moderate,\" indicates a state of distress. The guardian is feeling more stress and burden from caring for Ddaengja than joy and benefit. This is a critical state that, if unaddressed, can lead to caregiver burnout and negatively impact the human-dog bond.\\n    - **Interpretation**: The guardian is currently in a state of significant stress. The potty training issue is likely the primary contributor to this feeling of being overwhelmed. Counseling must prioritize not only solving the behavioral problem but also validating the guardian\\'s feelings and providing strategies to reduce this burden. The goal is to shift the balance so that the emotional benefits of the relationship can flourish.\\n\\n#### 2. Counseling Topics : Guardian’s Concerns and Root Causes\\n> Make the following content the central topic of the conversation.\\n\\n- **Topic 1: Potty Training Failure (Feces Only)**\\n    - **Situation description**: Ddaengja, a 16-week-old puppy, consistently urinates on the potty pad but defecates in other locations, specifically in corners.\\n    - **Guardian\\'s Needs**: The guardian\\'s primary need is to acquire a practical and effective training method to resolve this specific potty training issue. A crucial secondary need is emotional support and a strategy to reduce her high level of caregiving stress and frustration.\\n    - **Possible causes**:\\n        - **Cause 1: Substrate and Location Preference**: Puppies often develop distinct preferences for urination and defecation spots. Ddaengja may have developed a preference for the texture of the floor in the corners or for the privacy and security that a corner provides, which is separate from her urination spot preference.\\n        - **Cause 2: Incomplete Training and Management**: At 16 weeks, a puppy\\'s bladder and bowel control are still developing. The guardian may be expecting mastery too soon. The current management plan might not be sufficient to prevent accidents (e.g., lack of constant supervision), and the positive reinforcement for correct elimination may not be consistent or powerful enough to build a strong habit.\\n        - **Cause 3: Disrupted Denning Instinct from Pet Shop Origin**: Puppies raised in small pet shop enclosures are often forced to eliminate in their living space. This can weaken their natural instinct to keep their \"den\" clean, making house training more challenging than for a puppy raised in a different environment. She may not understand the concept of a single designated toilet area.\\n        - **Cause 4: Negative Association**: It\\'s possible, though not stated, that an accident was punished near the pad, creating an aversion. Alternatively, the pad might be in a location that feels too exposed or busy for the more vulnerable act of defecation.\\n\\n#### 3. Counseling Strategy\\n\\n- **(0) Language**: 한국어\\n\\n- **(1) Counseling Strategies**\\n\\n    - **Topic 1: Potty Training Failure (Feces Only)**\\n        - **(1) Counseling Goals**\\n            - To provide the guardian with a clear, step-by-step management and training plan to successfully teach Ddaengja to defecate on the potty pad.\\n            - To adjust the guardian\\'s expectations regarding the timeline for potty training, reframing it as a gradual learning process rather than a pass/fail test.\\n            - To directly address and reduce the guardian\\'s \"Very High\" emotional burden by validating her feelings and empowering her with effective, positive strategies.\\n\\n        - **(2) Contextual Strategies**\\n            - **Empathize and Validate First**: Begin by acknowledging the guardian\\'s frustration. Say something like, \"Potty training is one of the most stressful parts of having a new puppy, and it\\'s so frustrating when they get one part right but not the other. It\\'s completely normal to feel overwhelmed by this.\" Directly referencing the high burden score can also be powerful: \"I saw in your survey that the emotional burden feels very high right now. Our main goal today is to give you a plan that makes you feel more in control and less stressed.\"\\n            - **Reframe the Problem (CBT)**: Shift the guardian\\'s perspective from \"She is failing\" to \"We are still learning.\" Use reframing: \"The great news is that Ddaengja already understands the pad is for pottying—she\\'s got the pee part down! That\\'s a huge success. Now we just need to teach her that it\\'s for poop, too. She\\'s not being defiant; she\\'s just developed a different preference that we need to gently change.\"\\n            - **Use a Dog\\'s Perspective (Psychodrama)**: Help the guardian understand Ddaengja\\'s motivation. Ask, \"Let\\'s imagine we are little Ddaengja. What might make a corner feel safer or more comfortable for pooping than the middle of a pad? Maybe it\\'s quiet, enclosed, and feels more private. From her point of view, she\\'s not making a \\'mistake,\\' she\\'s just choosing the spot that feels best to her.\"\\n            - **Provide a Concrete, Phased Action Plan**: Give a short-term (1-2 week) plan focused on management and positive reinforcement.\\n                - **Step 1 (Management is Key)**: Explain that preventing accidents is the first priority. Recommend crate training or using a playpen to limit her access to the \"wrong\" spots when unsupervised.\\n                - **Step 2 (Make the Right Spot Easy)**: Advise temporarily placing a potty pad directly in the corner where she has been having accidents. This meets her where she is.\\n                - **Step 3 (Jackpot Reward)**: Instruct the guardian to identify Ddaengja\\'s pooping schedule (e.g., after meals, after waking) and take her to the pad at those times. When she poops on the pad, she should be rewarded with an extremely high-value \"jackpot\" treat (something special she only gets for this) and enthusiastic praise.\\n                - **Step 4 (Clean Thoroughly)**: Emphasize the need to clean all accident spots with an enzymatic cleaner to eliminate odor cues that attract her back to the same spot.\\n\\n        - **(3) Cautions**\\n            - **Avoid Promising a Quick Fix**: Stress that potty training is a process that requires patience and consistency, especially for a 16-week-old puppy. There will still be accidents.\\n            - **Strongly Advise Against Punishment**: Explicitly warn the guardian that scolding, yelling, or any form of punishment for accidents will only create fear, damage their bond, and likely make Ddaengja afraid to poop in front of her, leading to more hiding and accidents.\\n            - **Explain the \"Pet Shop Puppy\" Factor**: Gently explain that because of her unknown early history, Ddaengja might take a little longer to learn than other puppies. This is not her fault, and it just means she needs extra patience and consistency.\\n            - **Mention Vet Check as a Precaution**: While unlikely to be the cause, state that if the behavior doesn\\'t improve with consistent training, a check-up with the vet to rule out any gastrointestinal discomfort is always a good final step.\\n\\n#### 4. Key Questions for Further Clarification\\n\\n- **Topic 1: Potty Training Failure (Feces Only)**\\n    1.  Can you describe the exact routine? What happens right after Ddaengja eats a meal or wakes up from a nap? Where does she go? (This helps identify predictable moments for intervention.)\\n    2.  When you find that she has pooped in a corner, what has been your reaction so far? How do you clean it up? (This is to check for any unintentional punishment or use of non-enzymatic cleaners.)\\n    3.  What is the surface of the corners where she poops (e.g., hardwood, tile, near a rug)? And where are the potty pads located in the house? (This helps diagnose a potential surface or location preference.)\\n    4.  When she successfully urinates on the pad, what kind of reward or praise does she receive? How does that compare to the high-value \"jackpot\" treat we discussed? (This assesses the current reinforcement strategy.)\\n    5.  Are all three family members in the house following the same rules and reactions for potty training? (This checks for consistency, which is crucial for success.)\\n\\n\\n\\n# [4] Chat Record\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [1] Model\\n\\n\\n[back_current_phase]: [\\'[phase4] Transitioning Topics\\']\\n\\n[back_current_topic]: Initial Message\\n\\n[back_process_rate]: 0%\\n\\n[back_user_emotion]: 2\\n\\n안녕하세요, 사색을 좋아하는 비글이자 반려견 마음 통역사 까미예요. 🐾\\n땡자의 속마음을 더 깊이 읽어 보고, 우리 보호자님과 함께 잔잔한 파도를 넘어 보려고 해요.  \\n\\n### 상담 안내\\n보호자님의 반려생활 만족도 조사를 보니, 땡자를 향한 애정은 가득하지만, 감정적인 부담이 아주 높다고 느껴지셨군요. 😢\\n땡자와 함께하는 기쁨보다 스트레스가 더 크게 느껴지는 건, 보호자님께서 얼마나 많이 노력하고 계신지 보여주는 증거이기도 해요.  \\n이제 우리는 땡자라는 바다에 뛰어들어, 반려견을 천천히 이해해 나아갈 거예요.  \\n\\n### 대화를 시작해 볼게요.\\n\\n1. 배변 훈련 실패 (대변만)\\n\\n보호자님께서 전달해 주신 고민 내용이에요.  \\n어떤 주제에 대해 먼저 이야기해 보고 싶으세요?\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [2] User\\n\\n\\n넹 ㅜㅜㅜ\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [3] Model\\n\\n\\n[back_current_phase]: [\\'[phase1] Information Gathering\\']\\n\\n[back_current_topic]: Potty Training Failure (Feces Only)\\n\\n[back_process_rate]: 0%\\n\\n[back_user_emotion]: 1\\n\\n네, 배변 훈련에 대해 이야기 나눠볼게요.  \\n\\n땡자가 식사 후나 낮잠에서 깬 후에 주로 어디로 가는지, 그리고 그때 보호자님은 어떻게 하고 계시는지 알려주시겠어요?

The guardian needs a solution to reduce Ddaengja\\'s excessive scratching, paw biting, and tail chasing, which seem to be related to energy levels, boredom, and attention-seeking. The guardian also needs guidance on how to react to these behaviors without reinforcing them negatively.\\n2. Constraints: Ddaengja cannot go for walks due to incomplete vaccinations, limiting physical exercise. The guardian\\'s family is sensitive about Ddaengja\\'s scratching due to existing wounds. The current reaction of saying \"No\" or \"Don\\'t\" is not effective and might be causing stress. Personalized methods: Focus on indoor enrichment like nose work and short, frequent play sessions to manage energy. Emphasize positive reinforcement for calm behavior to shift attention-seeking. Address the underlying medical concern (scratching leading to wounds) by recommending a vet visit.\\n3. Alternatives: If the behaviors are purely medical, a vet visit is paramount. If behavioral, increasing mental stimulation (puzzle toys) and structured play could help. Desensitization to triggers (if any specific ones are identified for the self-mutilating behaviors) could also be considered for later stages. For now, the focus is on energy management and positive reinforcement.\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [60] User\\n\\n\\n오늘 울타리에서 풀어두고 배변훈련을 시키려 하는데 어떻게 하면 좋을까?\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [61] Model\\n\\n\\n[back_current_phase]: [\\'[phase3] Caregiving Solutions\\']\\n\\n[back_current_topic]: Potty Training Failure (Feces Only)\\n\\n[back_process_rate]: 100%\\n\\n[back_user_emotion]: 2\\n\\n네, 보호자님! 울타리에서 풀어두고 배변 훈련을 시킬 때, 땡자가 올바른 곳에서 응아를 할 수 있도록 돕는 방법을 알려드릴게요. ✨\\n\\n### 🐾 Step 2: 자유시간에도 배변 성공률 높이기\\n\\n> 땡자가 자유롭게 돌아다닐 때도 \\'응아는 패드에서!\\'라는 것을 기억하게 하는 시간이에요.  \\n\\n1.  **배변 유도**: 땡자가 식사 후나 낮잠에서 깬 후, 또는 놀다가 갑자기 냄새를 맡으며 빙글빙글 돌기 시작하면, 바로 땡자를 안아서 패드가 깔린 구석이나 배변판 위로 데려가 주세요.  \\n2.  **칭찬과 보상**: 땡자가 패드 위에서 응아를 성공하면, 즉시 \"옳지!\" 하고 크게 칭찬하며 땡자가 가장 좋아하는 간식(아주 작게 잘라서)을 주세요. 땡자가 응아를 끝내고 나올 때라도 칭찬과 간식을 주는 것을 잊지 마세요.  \\n3.  **실수 시 대처**: 만약 땡자가 다른 곳에 응아를 했다면, 절대 혼내지 마시고 조용히 효소 세정제로 깨끗하게 치워주세요. 땡자가 실수한 곳에 다시 응아를 하지 않도록 냄새를 완전히 제거하는 것이 중요해요.  \\n\\n### 🎯 목표\\n\\n- 땡자가 자유시간에도 응아는 패드 위에서 해야 한다는 것을 명확히 인식하고, 스스로 패드를 찾아가도록 하는 거예요.  \\n\\n### 🔎 주의 사항\\n\\n- **눈을 떼지 마세요**: 땡자가 자유롭게 돌아다닐 때는 항상 주시하며 배변 신호를 놓치지 않도록 해주세요.  \\n- **일관된 반응**: 가족 구성원 모두가 땡자의 배변 성공에 대해 같은 방식으로 칭찬하고 보상해야 땡자가 혼란스러워하지 않아요.  \\n- **인내심**: 배변 훈련은 시간이 필요한 과정이에요. 땡자가 실수하더라도 꾸준히 긍정적인 방법으로 지도해 주세요.  \\n\\n어떠신가요? 이 단계도 보호자님과 땡자에게 도움이 될 것 같나요? 🐾\\n\\n[back_thinking_solution]: 1. The guardian needs guidance on how to manage potty training when Ddaengja is out of the crate, specifically focusing on defecation on the pad. She needs actionable steps for intervention and reinforcement during free time.\\n2. Constraints: Ddaengja\\'s preference for corners for defecation and the guardian\\'s past reaction (scolding) need to be addressed. The guardian is already doing some positive reinforcement for urination, but it needs to be applied more consistently and with higher value for defecation. The unknown early history from the pet shop might make the process slower, requiring more patience.\\n3. Alternatives: If the current approach doesn\\'t yield results, consider temporarily confining Ddaengja to a smaller, pad-lined area during free time for shorter periods, gradually increasing the space as she shows consistency. Also, exploring different types of pads or a \"grass patch\" might be an option if substrate preference is very strong. For now, the focus is on consistent supervision, immediate positive reinforcement, and proper clean-up.\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [62] User\\n\\n\\n밥 먹을때 왜 식탁 사이사이를 왜 돌아다니는거야 발 밑에?\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [63] Model\\n\\n\\n[back_current_phase]: [\\'[phase1] Information Gathering\\']\\n\\n[back_current_topic]: Circling under the dining table during meals\\n\\n[back_process_rate]: 0%\\n\\n[back_user_emotion]: 2\\n\\n땡자가 식사 시간에 식탁 사이사이를 돌아다니는군요. 마치 땡자가 \"저도 여기 있어요!\" 하고 말하는 것 같아요. 🐾\\n\\n혹시 땡자가 식탁 밑을 돌아다닐 때, 보호자님이나 가족분들께서 땡자에게 어떤 반응을 보이시나요?\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [64] User\\n\\n\\n놀라고 이놈!하고 소리지르지\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [65] Model\\n\\n\\n[back_current_phase]: [\\'[phase1] Information Gathering\\', \"[phase2] Caring the Dog\\'s/Guardian\\'s Mind\"]\\n\\n[back_current_topic]: Circling under the dining table during meals\\n\\n[back_process_rate]: 10%\\n\\n[back_user_emotion]: 1\\n\\n\"놀라고 이놈!\" 하고 소리 지르시는군요. 땡자가 식탁 밑을 돌아다닐 때마다 깜짝 놀라실 보호자님의 마음이 이해가 가요. 😢\\n\\n땡자는 아마도 식탁 밑을 돌아다니면서 \"저도 가족들과 함께하고 싶어요!\" 또는 \"맛있는 냄새가 나는데, 저도 좀 나눠주세요!\" 하고 말하는 것일 수 있어요. 땡자가 식탁 밑을 돌아다닐 때, 혹시 음식을 떨어뜨리거나 땡자에게 주신 적이 있나요? 🐾\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [66] User\\n\\n\\n없어\\n\\n---\\n#### **Token Usage**\\n- 대화 비용: $0.15512579999999998\\n- 입력 토큰: 450561.0\\n- 출력 토큰: 7983.0\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n# [5] Feedback Response\\nNone\\n',\n",

Guardian & Dog Profiling\\n\\n> (1) Dog\\n-   **Basic information**: 사랑이 (Sarang-i), 7.7 years old, female (not neutered), Maltese\\n-   **Adoption method**: Purchased from a home breeder at 10 weeks old.\\n-   **Time since adoption**: Approximately 7.5 years.\\n-   **Lifestyle**: Lives indoors in a multi-pet household. Spends about 2 hours alone on weekdays.\\n-   **Walking routine**: 3 times a week, for 60 minutes each time. This frequency may be insufficient for a dog\\'s physical and mental stimulation needs.\\n-   **Socialization**: Separated from the mother at only 2 weeks, which is critically early and can lead to significant behavioral deficits, particularly in bite inhibition and social signaling. Interacted with 5-10 people during the primary socialization period. Current interaction with other dogs is rated as \"moderate.\"\\n-   **Health history**: No specific treatments in the last six months. However, new compulsive behaviors (licking) warrant a veterinary check-up.\\n-   **Level of threatening/aggressive behavior**: Level 3B - Has inflicted bites that broke the skin on multiple occasions. This is a significant level of aggression that requires careful management. The triggers are handling/grooming of the face.\\n-   **Triggers and levels of alertness/anxiety**:\\n    -   **Triggers**: Handling of face, tail, and paws; sudden touch; doorbell sounds (causes barking).\\n    -   **Anxiety Indicators**: Shows clear signs of separation anxiety (howling when left alone, constantly following the guardian). Engages in excessive licking to the point of skin damage. High impulsivity. Resource guards food, treats, and toys.\\n-   **Temperament and disposition**: Sarang-i appears to have a dichotomous temperament. On one hand, she is described as very affectionate (\"애교가 매우 많아요\") and seeks connection with her guardian. On the other hand, she is highly anxious and insecure. This insecurity manifests as separation anxiety, resource guarding, and fear-based aggression when her boundaries are crossed (handling sensitive areas). The extremely early separation from her mother is a likely root cause of her poor emotional regulation, lack of bite inhibition, and deep-seated anxiety. Her high impulsivity suggests she struggles to control her reactions to stimuli.\\n-   **Special notes**: The combination of Level 3B biting, significant anxiety symptoms, and resource guarding in a multi-pet household presents a complex and high-risk situation. The fact that she is not neutered could also be a contributing factor to certain behaviors, though it\\'s not the primary cause of her anxiety or aggression.\\n\\n> (2) Guardian and Care Environment\\n-   **Guardian (applicant) information**: 15-year-old female, primary caregiver (responsible for feeding, walks, etc.).\\n-   **Family composition**: 4 human members, 3 dogs, 2 other non-dog pets. This is a very busy and potentially high-stress environment for an anxious dog.\\n-   **Living space**: Apartment with 3 rooms.\\n-   **Financial situation**: Spends approximately 300,000 KRW per month on pet care.\\n-   **Guardian characteristics**: The guardian is very young and has been the primary caregiver for most of the dog\\'s life. She is deeply bonded with Sarang-i, as shown by the high emotional benefit score. However, her age may mean she has less experience in managing complex behavioral issues like resource guarding and aggression. Her love for the dog is clear, but she may need significant guidance on how to interpret behavior and implement management strategies safely.\\n-   **Special notes**: A 15-year-old acting as the primary caregiver for a dog with a Level 3B bite history is a point of concern. The counseling must prioritize the safety of the guardian and others in the household. The crowded multi-pet environment is a critical factor that likely contributes to Sarang-i\\'s stress and resource guarding.\\n\\n> (3) Pet Care Satisfaction\\n-   **Emotional benefit**: Very High (93.8)\\n-   **Emotional burden**: Moderate (56.3)\\n-   **Overall satisfaction**: High (68.8)\\n-   **Interpretation**: These scores reveal a very strong emotional bond. The guardian derives immense joy and affection from Sarang-i (Very High benefit). However, the behavioral challenges—likely the biting, anxiety, and the new licking issue—are creating a noticeable level of stress and difficulty (Moderate burden). Despite the burden, the love for the dog prevails, resulting in High overall satisfaction. The goal of counseling is to reduce the burden by providing understanding and effective management tools, thereby strengthening the already positive relationship.\\n\\n#### 2. Counseling Topics : Guardian’s Concerns and Root Causes\\n> Make the following content the central topic of the conversation.\\n\\n-   **Topic 1: Sudden Excessive Bed Licking**\\n    -   **Situation description**: Sarang-i has recently started to lick the bed excessively. This is a new behavior.\\n    -   **Guardian\\'s Needs**: The guardian is concerned and wants to understand the reason for this new, strange behavior. This falls under \"acquiring caregiving knowledge\" and \"improving problem behaviors.\"\\n    -   **Possible causes**:\\n        -   **Cause 1: Medical Issues (High Probability)**: Sudden onset of oral repetitive behaviors like licking is often linked to physical discomfort. This could include gastrointestinal issues (nausea, acid reflux), dental pain, allergies causing itchiness, or even neurological problems. This must be the first consideration.\\n        -   **Cause 2: Anxiety or Compulsive Disorder**: Licking can be a self-soothing mechanism. Given Sarang-i\\'s existing high anxiety (separation issues, etc.), this behavior could be a new coping strategy for stress. The stress could be triggered by subtle changes in the busy household environment.\\n        -   **Cause 3: Displacement Behavior**: The licking might be a way to displace stress or frustration when she feels conflicted or anxious, for example, due to the presence of other pets near a valued spot like the bed.\\n\\n-   **Topic 2: Understanding Sarang-i\\'s Personality and Reducing Biting**\\n    -   **Situation description**: The guardian wants to understand Sarang-i\\'s personality (\"성격\"). She also expresses a desire for the biting (\"입질\"), which occurs during handling of the face, to decrease. The biting has been severe enough to be classified as Level 3B.\\n    -   **Guardian\\'s Needs**: This is a combination of a \"philosophical discussion about dog care\" (understanding who her dog is) and a practical need to \"improve problem behaviors\" (reduce biting for a safer, healthier life together).\\n    -   **Possible causes**:\\n        -   **Cause 1: Severe Lack of Early Socialization**: Being separated from her mother at 2 weeks is the most significant factor. She never learned bite inhibition, how to read social cues, or how to cope with frustration from her mother and littermates. Her \"personality\" is fundamentally shaped by this early trauma.\\n        -   **Cause 2: Fear-Based Reactivity and Boundary Setting**: The biting is not malicious \"aggression\"; it is communication born from fear. When she is touched in sensitive areas, she feels threatened and uses her mouth to say \"STOP\" because other, more subtle signals have likely been ignored in the past. This is a defensive, not offensive, behavior.\\n        -   **Cause 3: Chronic Stress from Environment**: Living in a household with 4 other animals can be chronically stressful for an anxious dog. Competition for resources (food, space, guardian\\'s attention) is constant, likely exacerbating her resource guarding and general anxiety, lowering her threshold for reacting with a bite.\\n\\n#### 3. Counseling Strategy\\n\\n-   **(0) Language**: 한국어\\n\\n-   **(1) Counseling Strategies**\\n\\n    -   **Topic 1: Sudden Excessive Bed Licking**\\n        -   **(1) Counseling Goals**:\\n            -   To ensure the guardian understands the critical importance of ruling out medical causes by scheduling a veterinary examination as the immediate first step.\\n            -   To help the guardian identify potential environmental or social stressors that may have recently emerged.\\n            -   To provide simple management and enrichment strategies to redirect the behavior, *after* medical causes have been ruled out.\\n        -   **(2) Contextual Strategies**:\\n            -   Begin with empathy: \"It must be worrying to see Sarang-i suddenly start a new behavior like that. It\\'s very observant of you to notice and seek help.\"\\n            -   Prioritize medical advice: State clearly and firmly, \"Whenever a dog starts a new, repetitive behavior out of the blue, the very first thing we must do is talk to a veterinarian. It\\'s often their way of telling us something hurts or feels wrong inside. Could you make an appointment to get her checked for things like stomach discomfort or dental issues?\"\\n            -   Use Socratic questioning to investigate triggers: \"Let\\'s think back to when this started. Were there any changes at home? A new food? A change in your family\\'s schedule? Any new tensions between the pets?\"\\n            -   Introduce the concept of self-soothing: \"Sometimes, just like people might bite their nails when they\\'re nervous, dogs will lick to calm themselves down. We need to figure out *if* she\\'s feeling stressed, and why.\"\\n        -   **(3) Cautions**:\\n            -   **DO NOT** provide behavioral modification plans for the licking until a veterinarian has cleared the dog of any underlying medical conditions. This is an ethical and welfare priority.\\n            -   Avoid diagnosing a specific illness. Stick to advising a general vet check-up.\\n            -   Be mindful that the guardian is young. Explain concepts clearly and simply, without overwhelming her with jargon.\\n\\n    -   **Topic 2: Understanding Sarang-i\\'s Personality and Reducing Biting**\\n        -   **(1) Counseling Goals**:\\n            -   To reframe Sarang-i\\'s \"personality\" and \"biting\" from a problem to a form of communication rooted in early life experiences and fear.\\n            -   To educate the guardian on the profound impact of the 2-week separation from the mother, fostering deep empathy.\\n            -   To establish a strict \"no-touch\" policy on sensitive areas to immediately ensure the guardian\\'s safety and begin rebuilding the dog\\'s trust.\\n            -   To introduce the concept of cooperative care and management as a long-term, positive solution.\\n        -   **(2) Contextual Strategies**:\\n            -   Use reframing and psychodrama: \"Let\\'s try to see the world from Sarang-i\\'s perspective. She was taken from her mom before she could learn \\'how to be a dog.\\' She never learned how to say \\'please stop\\' gently. So when she bites, she\\'s not being \\'bad,\\' she\\'s screaming, \\'I\\'m scared! Please respect my space!\\' It\\'s the only language she knows for that feeling.\"\\n            -   Introduce the \"Trust Account\" metaphor: \"Every time we force her to endure a touch she fears, we make a withdrawal from our trust account. Right now, the account is low. Our goal is to make many small, positive deposits by respecting her boundaries and not touching her face or paws at all for now.\"\\n            -   Provide concrete, safe management solutions: \"For now, the most important rule is safety. We will stop trying to groom her face or touch her paws. When you need to, we can talk about using tools like a basket muzzle with a professional\\'s help. For now, let\\'s focus on avoiding the situations that make her feel she needs to bite.\"\\n            -   Use a fictional peer case: \"I once knew another Maltese who was also very sensitive about being touched. Her family learned to teach her to place her chin in their hand for treats, and over many months, she learned that hands near her face could be a good thing. It\\'s a long process built on trust.\"\\n        -   **(3) Cautions**:\\n            -   **The Level 3B bite history is serious.** Emphasize that punishment (scolding, hitting) will make the fear and aggression much worse and more dangerous.\\n            -   **Strongly recommend consultation with a certified, force-free behavior consultant or trainer** for in-person guidance, especially given the bite risk and the guardian\\'s age. This is not something that can be fully solved via chat.\\n            -   Ensure the advice empowers the young guardian but also protects her. The focus must be on management and prevention, not \"fixing\" the biting through direct confrontation.\\n\\n#### 4. Key Questions for Further Clarification\\n\\n-   **Topic 1: Sudden Excessive Bed Licking**\\n    1.  When exactly did this bed-licking behavior begin? Can you pinpoint the day or week?\\n    2.  Have there been any recent changes in her diet, the brand of her food, or new treats?\\n    3.  Does the licking happen at specific times of the day (e.g., only at night, after eating, when you are preparing to leave)?\\n    4.  Can you describe her body language while she\\'s licking? Does she seem tense, anxious, or calm and zoned-out?\\n    5.  How do you and your family members react when she starts licking the bed? What have you tried so far to stop it?\\n\\n-   **Topic 2: Understanding Sarang-i\\'s Personality and Reducing Biting**\\n    1.  Could you describe the most recent incident of biting in detail? What was the person doing, which part of Sarang-i\\'s body was being touched, and what happened immediately after the bite?\\n    2.  You mentioned resource guarding. What does she do when she has a high-value item and someone approaches? Does she freeze, growl, show her teeth, or snap?\\n    3.  How does Sarang-i get along with the other 2 dogs and 2 pets in the home? Are there fights over food, toys, or your attention?\\n    4.  How do you currently manage necessary grooming, like cleaning her eyes or trimming her nails?\\n    5.  You mentioned she is very affectionate. Can you describe how she likes to show affection and what kind of physical contact she enjoys and initiates herself? (This helps identify what she *is* comfortable with).\\n\\n\\n\\n# [4] Chat Record\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [1] Model\\n\\n\\n[back_current_phase]: [\\'[phase4] Transitioning Topics\\']\\n\\n[back_current_topic]: Initial Message\\n\\n[back_process_rate]: 0%\\n\\n[back_user_emotion]: 2\\n\\n안녕하세요, 사색을 좋아하는 비글이자 반려견 마음 통역사 까미예요. 🐶\\n사랑이의 속마음을 더 깊이 읽어 보고, 우리 보호자님과 함께 잔잔한 파도를 넘어 보려고 해요. \\n\\n### 상담 안내\\n사전 질문지를 통해 보호자님께서 사랑이에게 얼마나 깊은 애정을 가지고 계신지 느낄 수 있었어요. \\n사랑이와 함께하며 얻는 기쁨이 아주 크지만, 동시에 몇 가지 행동 문제들로 인해 걱정도 있으셨을 거예요. \\n이제 우리는 사랑이라는 바다에 뛰어들어, 반려견을 천천히 이해해 나아갈 거예요. \\n\\n### 대화를 시작해 볼게요.\\n\\n1. 갑작스러운 침대 과도하게 핥는 행동\\n2. 사랑이의 성격 이해 및 입질 줄이기\\n\\n보호자님께서 전달해 주신 고민 내용들이에요. \\n어떤 주제에 대해 먼저 이야기해 보고 싶으세요?\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [2] User\\n\\n\\n1번이요\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [3] Model\\n\\n\\n[back_current_phase]: [\\'[phase1] Information Gathering\\']\\n\\n[back_current_topic]: Sudden Excessive Bed Licking\\n\\n[back_process_rate]: 0%\\n\\n[back_user_emotion]: 2\\n\\n네, 좋아요. 갑작스러운 침대 핥기 행동에 대해 먼저 이야기해 볼까요?

Guardian & Dog Profiling\\n\\n> (1) Dog\\n- **Basic information**: 솜이 (Somi), 6 months, Male (Neutered), Coton de Tulear\\n- **Adoption method**: Adopted from a pet shop at 10 weeks old.\\n- **Time since adoption**: Approximately 16 weeks (4 months).\\n- **Lifestyle**: Spends about 10 hours alone on weekdays.\\n- **Walking routine**: Significantly insufficient. Only twice a week for 30 minutes. This lack of physical activity and mental stimulation is a major concern for a puppy\\'s development and well-being.\\n- **Socialization**: Limited. Has had no close contact with other dogs. Interacted with 5-10 people during the socialization period. The critical window for socialization is closing, and the lack of experience with other dogs is a significant gap.\\n- **Health history**: No specific treatments reported, but the primary counseling concern is a loss of appetite.\\n- **Level of threatening/aggressive behavior**: None reported.\\n- **Triggers and levels of alertness/anxiety**:\\n    - Shows clear signs of anxiety and stress.\\n    - **Triggers**: Plastic bag sounds, being left alone (or the guardian preparing to leave).\\n    - **Anxious Behaviors**: Urinates when the guardian prepares to leave, follows the guardian everywhere (\"Velcro dog\" tendency), engages in excessive licking to the point of skin damage.\\n    - **Hesitancy**: Uncomfortable with being touched on the head/ears and is not eager to approach new environments. This suggests a cautious and somewhat timid nature.\\n- **Temperament and disposition**: Somi appears to be a gentle and human-oriented puppy who is showing significant signs of stress and anxiety. His friendliness towards visiting strangers is a positive trait, but it\\'s overshadowed by behaviors indicative of separation anxiety (following, pre-departure urination, excessive licking) and general insecurity (hesitancy in new situations, sensitivity to sounds). This anxiety is likely exacerbated by his background (pet shop origin, likely early separation from mother) and current lifestyle (long hours alone, minimal walks/stimulation).\\n- **Special notes**: The combination of a pet shop origin, extremely long hours alone for a puppy, and a severe lack of walks creates a high-risk environment for developing more severe behavioral issues, particularly separation anxiety.\\n\\n> (2) Guardian and Care Environment\\n- **Guardian (applicant) information**: 33-year-old female, primary caregiver responsible for most aspects of care.\\n- **Family composition**: Two adults, one dog (Somi), and one other non-dog pet. A child under 3 is expected in the future.\\n- **Living space**: Apartment with 3 rooms, which is an adequate physical environment.\\n- **Financial situation**: Average monthly pet care cost is 100,000 KRW.\\n- **Guardian characteristics**: The guardian demonstrates a strong emotional bond and a clear desire for the dog\\'s well-being (\"Let\\'s eat well and grow up healthy\"). However, there appears to be a significant gap between her intentions and the current care practices (especially regarding walks and alone time). Her request for a simple \"solution\" suggests she may be feeling overwhelmed and looking for direct, actionable advice, possibly without a full understanding of the underlying behavioral causes.\\n- **Special notes**: The impending arrival of a baby is a critical factor. The current issues (especially separation anxiety and lack of routine) will likely be severely amplified after the baby is born. Proactive management is essential to prevent future problems like jealousy or the dog being rehomed.\\n\\n> (3) Pet Care Satisfaction\\n- **Emotional benefit**: Very High (93.8)\\n- **Emotional burden**: Very High (81.3)\\n- **Overall satisfaction**: Moderate (56.3)\\n- **Interpretation**: These scores paint a picture of a guardian who loves her dog deeply but is also experiencing significant stress and difficulty. The high emotional benefit indicates a strong bond, but the equally high burden suggests that the challenges of puppy care are causing considerable strain. This is a crucial point for counseling; the goal is to reduce the guardian\\'s burden by providing effective strategies, which will, in turn, improve the overall satisfaction and the human-animal bond.\\n\\n#### 2. Counseling Topics : Guardian’s Concerns and Root Causes\\n> Make the following content the central topic of the conversation.\\n\\n- **Topic 1: Loss of appetite since teething began**\\n    - **Situation description**: Somi, a 6-month-old puppy, has shown a decreased appetite since his baby teeth started falling out.\\n    - **Guardian\\'s Needs**: The guardian is seeking a direct \"solution\" to resolve the eating issue, indicating a need for practical, knowledge-based guidance.\\n    - **Possible causes**:\\n        - **Cause 1 (Primary/Medical)**: Discomfort from teething. This is the most common and likely reason. The puppy\\'s gums are sore and inflamed, making it painful to chew hard kibble.\\n        - **Cause 2 (Medical/Precautionary)**: Underlying health issues. While less likely, any persistent anorexia in a puppy should be evaluated by a veterinarian to rule out other illnesses.\\n        - **Cause 3 (Behavioral/Contributing)**: Stress and anxiety. The high level of stress Somi experiences from long periods of isolation and under-stimulation can manifest physically, including a suppressed appetite.\\n\\n- **Topic 2: Signs of Separation Anxiety and Insufficient Stimulation (Expert-Identified)**\\n    - **Situation description**: Somi is left alone for 10 hours daily, is walked only twice a week, urinates when the guardian prepares to leave, follows the guardian constantly, and licks himself excessively.\\n    - **Guardian\\'s Needs**: The guardian has not identified this as a primary problem, so the initial need is **awareness**. The counseling must help her connect these behaviors to the dog\\'s emotional state and daily routine. Subsequently, the need becomes acquiring **caregiving knowledge** and a practical plan to **improve the dog\\'s welfare**.\\n    - **Possible causes**:\\n        - **Cause 1: Chronic Stress from Unmet Needs**: A puppy\\'s fundamental needs for physical exercise, mental enrichment, and social contact are not being met. This leads to profound boredom, frustration, and anxiety, which are channeled into the observed behaviors.\\n        - **Cause 2: Developing Separation Anxiety**: The combination of a possible premature separation from his mother (pet shop origin) and the current routine (long isolation followed by intense contact) fosters hyper-attachment. The urination upon departure cues and constant following are classic signs. The excessive licking is a self-soothing (stereotypic) behavior to cope with anxiety.\\n\\n#### 3. Counseling Strategy\\n\\n- **(0) Language**: 한국어\\n\\n- **(1) Counseling Strategies**\\n\\n    - **Topic 1: Loss of appetite since teething began**\\n        - **(1) Counseling Goals**\\n            - To reassure the guardian that a temporary loss of appetite during teething is normal while also stressing the importance of monitoring.\\n            - To provide the guardian with 2-3 simple, actionable methods to make food more appealing and easier to eat for Somi.\\n            - To have the guardian agree to a veterinary consultation to rule out any other medical causes, establishing a \"welfare-first\" principle.\\n        - **(2) Contextual Strategies**\\n            - **Information Gathering & Validation**: Begin by validating the guardian\\'s worry. \"It\\'s very natural to be concerned when your puppy, who is like family, suddenly stops eating. Let\\'s figure this out together.\" Then, use the key questions from Section 4 to understand the specifics.\\n            - **Caregiving Solutions (Phase 3)**: Offer simple, non-medical solutions. \"Since his gums are likely very sore, chewing hard food can feel like us trying to eat nuts with a toothache. Let\\'s try soaking his kibble in warm water or puppy-safe bone broth for 10-15 minutes to soften it. You could also try mixing in a spoonful of plain puppy wet food to entice him.\"\\n            - **CBT for the Guardian**: Reframe the situation from a \"problem\" to a \"developmental phase.\" \"This isn\\'t a sign that Somi is a picky eater; it\\'s a temporary stage of his puppyhood. By helping him through it, you\\'re strengthening your bond and teaching him you\\'re there for him when he\\'s uncomfortable.\"\\n        - **(3) Cautions**\\n            - **Crucially, do not give medical advice.** Firmly and clearly state that you are not a veterinarian and that the first and most important step is to consult a vet to ensure nothing else is wrong.\\n            - Do not dismiss the concern. Acknowledge that while it\\'s likely teething, it\\'s always best to be safe.\\n            - Advise the guardian that if the appetite loss is complete (refusing all food/water) or is accompanied by lethargy, vomiting, or diarrhea, a vet visit is an immediate necessity.\\n\\n    - **Topic 2: Signs of Separation Anxiety and Insufficient Stimulation**\\n        - **(1) Counseling Goals**\\n            - To gently guide the guardian to see the link between Somi\\'s daily routine (10 hours alone, 2 walks/week) and his anxious behaviors (urination, following, licking).\\n            - To collaboratively create a realistic, incremental plan to increase physical and mental stimulation.\\n            - To help the guardian understand the importance of establishing a healthy, predictable routine now, especially in preparation for the new baby.\\n        - **(2) Contextual Strategies**\\n            - **Transitioning Topics (Phase 4)**: After providing solutions for the eating issue, pivot gently. \"I\\'m glad we have a plan for his meals. As we think about his overall happiness and health, I noticed from the survey that he has a lot of quiet time to himself during the week. Sometimes behaviors like following you around or licking a lot can be a dog\\'s way of saying \\'I\\'m feeling a bit bored or anxious.\\' Could we talk a little about his daily routine?\"\\n            - **Psychodrama/Empathy Building**: Use role-reversal or guided imagery. \"Let\\'s imagine for a moment we are Somi. We\\'ve been sleeping and waiting all day in the same apartment. What\\'s the one thing we\\'re looking forward to more than anything? What does it feel like when our favorite person finally comes home?\" This helps the guardian connect emotionally to the dog\\'s experience of under-stimulation and isolation.\\n            - **Caregiving Solutions (Phase 3)**: Focus on small, manageable changes to avoid overwhelming the guardian. Instead of saying \"He needs two walks a day,\" suggest, \"What if we tried adding just one extra 15-minute \\'sniff walk\\' this week on a weekday evening? It\\'s less about exercise and more about letting him explore the world with his nose, which is incredibly calming for a dog.\" Suggest simple enrichment like a frozen Kong or a snuffle mat to keep him occupied when alone.\\n        - **(3) Cautions**\\n            - **Avoid guilt and blame.** The guardian\\'s emotional burden is already \"Very High.\" Frame all suggestions as supportive, collaborative efforts to help both her and Somi. Use \"we\" language: \"What can we do to make his alone time a little more interesting?\"\\n            - Acknowledge her busy schedule. If financially possible, gently inquire about options like a local dog walker or puppy daycare, even just once or twice a week, to break up the long days.\\n            - Introduce the topic of the baby with care and foresight. \"Building a predictable and enriching routine for Somi now will be a lifesaver for everyone\\'s stress levels when the new baby arrives. A happy, fulfilled dog is much more likely to adapt well to such a big family change.\"\\n            - Strongly recommend consultation with a certified professional dog trainer (CPDT-KA) or behavior consultant to work on the separation anxiety and baby preparation hands-on.\\n\\n#### 4. Key Questions for Further Clarification\\n\\n- **Topic 1: Loss of appetite since teething began**\\n    - \"Can you tell me exactly what you\\'re feeding him now? And has he ever been a picky eater before this started?\"\\n    - \"Is he refusing his kibble completely, or does he just eat less of it? Will he still eagerly take high-value treats, like chicken or cheese?\"\\n    - \"Have you noticed him chewing on things more or less than usual? Have you found any baby teeth on the floor?\"\\n    - \"Besides the appetite, have you noticed any other changes in his behavior, such as being more tired, having diarrhea, or whining?\"\\n    - \"When you offer him food, what does he do? Does he sniff it and walk away, or does he seem to try to eat and then stop?\"\\n\\n- **Topic 2: Signs of Separation Anxiety and Insufficient Stimulation**\\n    - \"Can you walk me through your morning routine? At what exact point during your preparations to leave does Somi start to show anxious behavior or urinate?\"\\n    - \"You mentioned he licks himself excessively. Which part of his body does he focus on, and have you noticed if it happens more at certain times of the day?\"\\n    - \"On the two days a week that you walk him, what is his energy and behavior like before, during, and after the walk?\"\\n    - \"What does Somi do for the 7 hours you are home with him? How much of that time is spent actively playing or training with you versus him just following you around?\"\\n    - \"What are your thoughts on trying to add a very short walk or a food puzzle toy to his daily routine? What feels most achievable for you right now?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n# [4] Chat Record\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [1] Model\\n\\n\\n[back_current_phase]: [\\'[phase4] Transitioning Topics\\']\\n\\n[back_current_topic]: Initial Message\\n\\n[back_process_rate]: 0%\\n\\n[back_user_emotion]: 2\\n\\n안녕하세요, 사색을 좋아하는 비글이자 반려견 마음 통역사 까미예요. 🐶\\n솜이의 속마음을 더 깊이 읽어 보고, 우리 보호자님과 함께 잔잔한 파도를 넘어 보려고 해요. \\n\\n### 상담 안내\\n보호자님의 반려생활 만족도 조사 결과를 보니, 솜이를 향한 깊은 사랑과 애정은 변함없지만, 동시에 육체적, 심리적으로 큰 부담을 느끼고 계신 것 같아 마음이 쓰여요. \\n하지만 걱정하지 말아요. 솜이의 마음을 이해하고 함께 성장하는 과정에서 보호자님의 부담도 한결 가벼워질 거예요. \\n이제 우리는 솜이라는 바다에 뛰어들어, 반려견을 천천히 이해해 나아갈 거예요. \\n\\n### 대화를 시작해 볼게요.\\n\\n1. 이갈이 시작 후 식욕 부진\\n2. 분리불안 징후와 부족한 자극\\n\\n보호자님께서 전달해 주신 고민 내용들이에요. \\n어떤 주제에 대해 먼저 이야기해 보고 싶으세요?\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [2] User\\n\\n\\n1번\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [3] Model\\n\\n\\n[back_current_phase]: [\\'[phase1] Information Gathering\\']\\n\\n[back_current_topic]: Loss of appetite since teething began\\n\\n[back_process_rate]: 0%\\n\\n[back_user_emotion]: 2\\n\\n이갈이 시기에는 잇몸이 아파서 식욕이 줄어드는 경우가 많아요. 마치 우리가 이가 아플 때 딱딱한 음식을 피하는 것과 비슷하죠. \\n\\n솜이가 지금 어떤 사료를 먹고 있는지, 그리고 이갈이 전에도 편식하는 경향이 있었는지 알려주시겠어요?

Guardian & Dog Profiling\\n\\n> (1) Dog\\n- **Basic information**: Hongsam, 2.6 years old, female (neutered), Norwich Terrier.\\n- **Adoption method**: Adopted from a breeder.\\n- **Time since adoption**: Since 10 weeks of age.\\n- **Lifestyle**: Spends approximately 9 hours alone on weekdays.\\n- **Walking routine**: Twice a day, 40 minutes each session (total 80 mins/day).\\n- **Socialization**: Separated from mother at 3 weeks (which is very early). Well-socialized with other dogs (\"plays very well\") and people (interacted with 11-20 people during her socialization period). Knows numerous commands well, even without treats.\\n- **Health history**: No specific health issues reported in the last six months.\\n- **Level of threatening/aggressive behavior**: Low. Barks at strangers when in a shared space with her friends (people), suggesting potential territorial or protective behavior. No bite history.\\n- **Triggers and levels of alertness/anxiety**:\\n    - **Dislikes**: Being held, kissed, or stared at directly in the face.\\n    - **Wary of**: Preschool-aged children, vacuum cleaners.\\n    - **Anxious at**: The vet clinic (ears/tail down, tries to escape).\\n    - **Shows guarding behavior**: Seems to guard the space she is in when with her friends.\\n    - **Separation-related behavior**: Urinates when the guardian prepares to leave; follows the guardian everywhere in the house.\\n- **Temperament and disposition**: Hongsam is an intelligent, energetic, and generally confident dog who is curious about new environments. However, her early separation from her mother (3 weeks) may be a contributing factor to some underlying insecurities. She has a distinctly independent nature, valuing her personal space and disliking invasive physical contact. This is contrasted by \"shadowing\" behavior (following the guardian) and pre-departure urination, which suggest a mild attachment anxiety. Her high excitability and impulsivity indicate a high arousal level that requires careful management and appropriate outlets.\\n- **Special notes**: The early separation from her mother is a critical piece of background information. The guardian\\'s description of her as \"independent\" while also observing following behavior and separation-related urination presents a key paradox to explore during counseling.\\n\\n> (2) Guardian and Care Environment\\n- **Guardian (applicant) information**: 34-year-old female, primary caregiver.\\n- **Family composition**: Two adults, one dog (Hongsam).\\n- **Living space**: Apartment with three rooms.\\n- **Financial situation**: High investment in pet care (approx. 1 million KRW/month), indicating a high level of commitment.\\n- **Guardian characteristics**: The guardian is highly dedicated, invested, and emotionally bonded with Hongsam. She is proactive and insightful, seeking counseling not to fix a \"problem dog\" but to deepen her understanding. She respects Hongsam\\'s boundaries (e.g., dislikes being held) but may benefit from a deeper understanding of the nuances behind behaviors like walk refusal and shadowing. Her primary goal is to learn, making her an ideal candidate for a collaborative counseling approach.\\n- **Special notes**: The extremely high satisfaction scores and financial investment signal a guardian who is highly motivated and will likely be very receptive to implementing suggested strategies.\\n\\n> (3) Pet Care Satisfaction\\n- **Emotional benefit**: Very High (100.0)\\n- **Emotional burden**: Very Low (18.8)\\n- **Overall satisfaction**: Very High (90.6)\\n- **Interpretation**: These scores reflect an exceptionally strong and positive bond between the guardian and Hongsam. The relationship is a significant source of joy for the guardian, with minimal stress. This context is crucial: the counseling should focus on enrichment, fine-tuning, and deepening understanding, rather than urgent problem-solving. The guardian\\'s goal of \"understanding my dog better\" is a perfect reflection of this healthy dynamic.\\n\\n#### 2. Counseling Topics : Guardian’s Concerns and Root Causes\\n> Make the following content the central topic of the conversation.\\n\\n-  **Topic 1: Walking-Related Issues (Refusal to Walk & Outdoor-Only Elimination)**\\n    - **Situation description**: Hongsam sometimes refuses to go on walks. Additionally, she exclusively eliminates outdoors, which may be an inconvenience for the guardian and a source of stress for the dog in certain situations (e.g., bad weather).\\n    - **Guardian\\'s Needs**: To understand the root cause of the walk refusal and learn strategies to make walks consistently positive. To explore the reasons for outdoor-only elimination and decide if training for an indoor option is necessary or desired. The core need is to understand Hongsam\\'s perspective.\\n    - **Possible causes**:\\n        - **Cause 1: Environmental Fear/Anxiety**: Something on the walk route may be frightening Hongsam (e.g., loud noises, unpredictable movements from children, other specific triggers). Her wariness of vacuums suggests a sensitivity to loud, sudden noises.\\n        - **Cause 2: Over-Arousal or \"Trigger Stacking\"**: As an excitable and impulsive dog, the anticipation of the walk or stimuli encountered early on could be overwhelming, leading to a \"shutdown\" or avoidance response (refusal).\\n        - **Cause 3: Physical Discomfort**: Although no health issues are reported, subtle, undiagnosed pain (e.g., in her paws, joints, or back) could make walking unpleasant. A veterinary check is a necessary step to rule this out.\\n        - **Cause 4: Strong Habit & Preference (for elimination)**: Hongsam has likely been conditioned since puppyhood that outdoors is the only appropriate place to eliminate, creating a very strong substrate and location preference.\\n\\n- **Topic 2: Indoor Enrichment and Understanding Temperament**\\n    - **Situation description**: Hongsam spends nine hours alone on weekdays. The guardian wants to provide more behavioral enrichment indoors. This is directly linked to her primary goal of understanding Hongsam\\'s independent yet excitable nature.\\n    - **Guardian\\'s Needs**: To acquire practical and effective indoor enrichment strategies. To gain deeper insight into Hongsam\\'s personality, particularly how to meet the needs of an intelligent, high-energy terrier who prefers non-physical forms of interaction.\\n    - **Possible causes**:\\n        - **Cause 1: Need for Mental Stimulation**: As an intelligent Norwich Terrier, Hongsam requires significant mental exercise to prevent boredom, which can manifest as anxiety or frustration. Walks alone are not enough.\\n        - **Cause 2: Channeling High Arousal**: Enrichment activities, especially scent work and problem-solving puzzles, are excellent ways to channel her natural excitability and impulsivity into calm, focused behavior.\\n        - **Cause 3: Building a Bond Through Shared Activities**: For a dog that dislikes cuddling, shared activities like training and games are the primary language of affection. The guardian\\'s desire for enrichment is also a desire for a deeper, more meaningful connection that respects Hongsam\\'s boundaries.\\n\\n#### 3. Counseling Strategy\\n\\n- (0) Language: 한국어\\n\\n- (1) Counseling Strategies\\n\\n    - **Topic 1: Walking-Related Issues (Refusal to Walk & Outdoor-Only Elimination)**\\n        - **(1) Counseling Goals**\\n            - The guardian will be able to identify at least two potential triggers for walk refusal by observing Hongsam\\'s body language before and during walk preparations.\\n            - To implement a \"happy start\" routine using positive reinforcement to build a positive association with starting a walk.\\n            - The guardian will understand the pros and cons of outdoor-only elimination and make an informed decision about whether to pursue indoor potty training.\\n        - **(2) Contextual Strategies**\\n            - **Information Gathering**: Use the \"Key Questions\" to pinpoint the specifics of the refusal. Ask the guardian to become a \"detective\" and note down the circumstances around each refusal.\\n            - **Caring the Mind (Psychodrama)**: Reframe the refusal as communication, not defiance. Use a monologue from Hongsam\\'s perspective: *\"My home is my safe castle. I love walks, but sometimes the world outside feels too big, too loud, or just... too much. When I stop, I\\'m not being stubborn, I\\'m telling you I feel unsure. I need your help to feel brave.\"* This fosters empathy and shifts the guardian\\'s mindset from frustration to support.\\n            - **Caregiving Solutions**:\\n                - **Walk Refusal**: Introduce a \"consent test\" - pick up the leash and see if Hongsam leans in or away. Suggest starting with very short, high-value \"sniffing trips\" just outside the door and back in, gradually extending the duration. Recommend letting Hongsam choose the direction of the walk to give her a sense of control.\\n                - **Elimination**: Discuss the reality of house-training a 2.6-year-old dog with a strong preference. Frame it as a long-term project. If the guardian wishes to proceed, provide a clear, step-by-step plan for introducing a potty pad with a verbal cue and rewarding any interest or use heavily.\\n        - **(3) Cautions**\\n            - **Crucially, advise against ever pulling or forcing Hongsam to walk.** This will only increase her anxiety and worsen the problem.\\n            - **Strongly recommend a veterinary check-up to rule out pain** as a primary cause before implementing behavioral strategies.\\n            - Manage expectations regarding potty training. It can be a slow process with regressions, and success is not guaranteed.\\n\\n    - **Topic 2: Indoor Enrichment and Understanding Temperament**\\n        - **(1) Counseling Goals**\\n            - The guardian will create a weekly enrichment plan that includes at least three different types of activities (e.g., puzzle toy, scent work, new trick training).\\n            - The guardian will be able to articulate how enrichment serves as a primary form of affection and communication for an \"independent\" dog like Hongsam.\\n            - To reframe the guardian\\'s understanding of Hongsam\\'s \"independence\" as a communication style, not a lack of love, strengthening their bond.\\n        - **(2) Contextual Strategies**\\n            - **Information Gathering**: Ask what toys and games Hongsam currently enjoys to build upon her existing preferences.\\n            - **Caring the Mind (CBT/Reframing)**: Challenge the potential negative connotation of \"independent.\"\\n                - *Automatic Thought:* \"My dog is independent and doesn\\'t like me to touch her, so maybe she doesn\\'t love me as much.\"\\n                - *Socratic Questioning:* \"You mentioned she follows you everywhere. What do you think that says about her feelings for you?\"\\n                - *Reframing:* \"Hongsam shows her deep trust and affection by choosing to be in your space. Following you is her way of \\'hugging\\' you from a comfortable distance. Enrichment games are how you can \\'hug\\' her back in a language she understands and loves.\"\\n            - **Caregiving Solutions**: Provide a \"menu\" of enrichment options tailored to a terrier:\\n                - **Scent Work**: \"Find the treat\" games, hiding treats in a snuffle mat or around a room.\\n                - **Problem-Solving**: Introduce puzzle toys, starting with Level 1 and progressing slowly.\\n                - **\"Destruction\"**: Provide a \"dig box\" with safe materials or a cardboard box with treats inside for her to shred (supervised).\\n                - **Training**: Teach fun, low-pressure tricks like \"spin\" or \"paws up\" to build cognitive skills and reinforce their bond.\\n        - **(3) Cautions**\\n            - Advise introducing new enrichment items slowly to prevent frustration or fear.\\n            - Emphasize that all enrichment activities, especially with toys that can be chewed, should be supervised for safety.\\n            - Remind the guardian that enrichment is meant to be fun, not a chore. If Hongsam isn\\'t interested in an activity, it\\'s okay to try something else.\\n\\n#### 4. Key Questions for Further Clarification\\n\\n- **Topic 1: Walking-Related Issues (Refusal to Walk & Outdoor-Only Elimination)**\\n    - Can you describe exactly what happens when Hongsam refuses to walk? Does she plant her feet at the door, in the hallway, or once you are outside?\\n    - What is your immediate reaction when she stops? Do you try to coax her with words, use treats, pull the leash, or do you give up and go back inside?\\n    - Have you noticed if the refusal is linked to a specific time of day, a particular walking route, the weather, or if you\\'ve recently passed by something specific (like a construction site or a home with children)?\\n    - Regarding elimination: On days with severe weather, what is her behavior? Does she hold her bladder/bowels for an uncomfortably long time? How does this situation make you feel?\\n    - When she is walking willingly, what is her general body language? Is she relaxed and sniffing, or often tense and scanning her surroundings?\\n\\n- **Topic 2: Indoor Enrichment and Understanding Temperament**\\n    - What types of toys and puzzle feeders does Hongsam currently have, and which ones are her favorites?\\n    - You mentioned she is excitable. Can you give me a specific example of this? What triggers the excitement, and what does the behavior look like (e.g., jumping, spinning, barking)?\\n    - Since she dislikes being held, what are some of the ways you currently interact that she seems to genuinely enjoy?

Guardian & Dog Profiling\\n\\n> (1) Dog\\n- **Basic information**: Dodo, 7.3 years old, female (not neutered), Mix breed.\\n- **Adoption method**: Adopted from an animal shelter.\\n- **Time since adoption**: 7.3 years (Adopted as a very young puppy).\\n- **Lifestyle**: Spends approximately 8 hours alone on weekdays. Lives with a family of 5.\\n- **Walking routine**: 4 times per week, for 10 minutes each time. This frequency and duration are quite low, potentially leading to insufficient physical and mental stimulation.\\n- **Socialization**: Experience is severely limited. The pre-survey indicates she has had no close contact with other dogs and interacted with fewer than 5 people during her critical socialization period. This is a significant factor in her current behavior.\\n- **Health history**: No specific health issues reported other than routine vaccinations. She is not neutered.\\n- **Level of threatening/aggressive behavior**: The guardian reported \\'none\\', but the described behaviors (barking, growling, lunging at visitors) are clear threatening/defensive signals. This indicates a potential misunderstanding by the guardian of what constitutes aggression. The behavior is defensive and fear-based, not offensive.\\n- **Triggers and levels of alertness/anxiety**:\\n    - **Primary Trigger**: The guardian\\'s father. Dodo barks and growls \"almost every time\" he moves.\\n    - **Secondary Trigger**: Strangers visiting the home. She barks and lunges at them.\\n    - **General Anxiety**: Shows wariness in new environments and towards new objects. Stiffens and stares during vet visits. Follows the primary guardian constantly, which can be a sign of insecurity.\\n- **Temperament and disposition**: Dodo appears to be a sensitive and anxious dog with a strong attachment to her primary guardian. Her behavior stems from a lack of socialization and deep-seated fear, particularly towards men and unfamiliar situations. She is not described as generally impulsive or hyperactive, but her reactions to specific fear triggers are intense and immediate. Her world seems to be divided into \\'safe\\' (the guardian) and \\'unsafe\\' (father, strangers, new places).\\n- **Special notes**: The most critical point is the guardian\\'s perception gap regarding threatening behavior. The fear seems specifically directed at adult men, with her father being the most consistent trigger. The minimal walking routine is a key area for potential improvement to help manage her overall stress and anxiety.\\n\\n> (2) Guardian and Care Environment\\n- **Guardian (applicant) information**: 19-year-old female, serves as the primary caregiver (responsible for feeding, walks, etc.).\\n- **Family composition**: 5 family members, including the father who is the trigger for the dog\\'s reactivity. One dog (Dodo) in the household.\\n- **Living space**: Apartment/house with 2 rooms.\\n- **Financial situation**: Spends approximately 300,000 KRW per month on pet care, which appears sufficient.\\n- **Guardian characteristics**: The guardian is deeply bonded with Dodo and highly motivated to understand her, as evidenced by her focus on \"cause analysis.\" She is not feeling burdened by the dog\\'s behavior, which is a very positive foundation for counseling. However, as a young guardian, she may lack experience in interpreting dog behavior and may face challenges in implementing changes that require cooperation from other family members (especially her father).\\n- **Special notes**: The core of the issue lies within the family dynamic. The constant presence of the trigger (the father) in the home creates a chronic state of stress for Dodo. The success of any intervention will likely depend on the father\\'s willingness to participate.\\n\\n> (3) Pet Care Satisfaction\\n- **Emotional benefit**: High (75.0)\\n- **Emotional burden**: Very Low (18.8)\\n- **Overall satisfaction**: High (78.1)\\n- **Interpretation**: These scores indicate a very strong, positive bond between the guardian and Dodo. The guardian derives significant emotional fulfillment from the relationship and does not perceive the problem behaviors as a major burden. This high level of motivation and low level of frustration is an ideal starting point for counseling, as the guardian\\'s primary goal is to help her dog, not just to stop an annoying behavior.\\n\\n#### 2. Counseling Topics : Guardian’s Concerns and Root Causes\\n> Make the following content the central topic of the conversation.\\n\\n-  **Topic 1: Fear-based Reactivity Towards the Father**\\n    - **Situation description**: Dodo exhibits significant fear and defensive behavior (barking, growling) almost every time the guardian\\'s father moves. This is part of a broader wariness towards adult men.\\n    - **Guardian\\'s Needs**: The guardian\\'s primary request is for **cause analysis**. She wants to understand *why* Dodo behaves this way, more so than receiving an immediate action plan for behavior change. This points to a need for knowledge, deeper understanding of her dog\\'s emotional world, and empathy.\\n    - **Possible causes**:\\n        - **Cause 1: Insufficient Socialization**: This is the most probable root cause. The survey confirms Dodo had extremely limited exposure to different types of people, especially men, during her critical socialization period (3-16 weeks). Without early positive experiences, she learned to perceive unfamiliar human archetypes (like large men with deep voices) as potential threats.\\n        - **Cause 2: Negative Past Experience**: It\\'s possible Dodo had a frightening experience involving a man (or the father himself) when she was a puppy. This single event could have created a lasting fear association (one-trial learning).\\n        - **Cause 3: Trigger-Specific Characteristics**: The father may have physical or behavioral traits that Dodo finds intimidating—a deep voice, large stature, sudden movements, or direct eye contact. Even without ill intent, these can be perceived as threatening by a fearful dog. The behavior is a distance-increasing signal, essentially Dodo screaming, \"Please don\\'t come any closer, you scare me!\"\\n\\n#### 3. Counseling Strategy\\n\\n- (0) Language: 한국어\\n\\n- (1) Counseling Strategies\\n\\n    - **Topic 1: Fear-based Reactivity Towards the Father**\\n        - **(1) Counseling Goals**\\n            - To help the guardian reframe Dodo\\'s barking and growling from \"bad behavior\" to \"communication of fear,\" fostering empathy.\\n            - To educate the guardian on the critical role of the socialization period and how its absence has shaped Dodo\\'s current worldview.\\n            - To provide the guardian with simple, safe management techniques to immediately lower Dodo\\'s daily stress levels and prevent the father from triggering her.\\n            - To empower the guardian to become a \"behavior detective\" to identify the specific micro-triggers associated with her father\\'s actions.\\n\\n        - **(2) Contextual Strategies**\\n            - **Phase 1: Validate and Educate.** Start by validating the guardian\\'s love for Dodo and praising her for seeking to understand the \\'why\\'. \"It\\'s wonderful that you\\'re not just asking how to stop the barking, but why it\\'s happening. That shows how deeply you care for Dodo\\'s well-being.\" Then, gently introduce the concept of the socialization period. Use an analogy: \"Imagine a child who only ever met one type of person. When they finally meet someone very different, it can be scary. For Dodo, who met very few people as a puppy, your father might seem like a complete unknown, and that\\'s frightening for her.\"\\n            - **Phase 2: Reframe using Psychodrama.** Use a monologue to voice Dodo\\'s perspective. \"If Dodo could talk, she might say, \\'My person is my safe place. But that other big person in the house... his movements are unpredictable and his voice is loud. I don\\'t know what he wants. I have to bark to keep him away and protect myself and my safe person. I\\'m not being bad, I\\'m just really scared.\\'\" This shifts the focus from disobedience to emotion.\\n            - **Phase 3: Introduce Management Solutions (not training).** Since the guardian wants analysis first, focus on immediate management to reduce stress. Suggest creating a \"Dodo\\'s Safe Haven\" – a comfy bed or open crate in a corner of the room where the father agrees never to approach. This gives Dodo a place to retreat to. Also, suggest the father could try tossing a high-value treat in Dodo\\'s direction *without looking at her or talking to her* whenever he enters a room or gets up. This begins to build a new, positive association (Classical Counter-Conditioning).\\n            - **Phase 4: Empower the Guardian with CBT.** Encourage the guardian to challenge the automatic thought \"Dodo hates my dad.\" Ask her to gather evidence. \"For the next week, could you be a detective? Let\\'s make a small log. Note exactly what your father was doing when Dodo barked. Was he standing up? Walking toward you? Reaching for something? This will give us the clues we need to truly understand Dodo\\'s triggers.\"\\n\\n        - **(3) Cautions**\\n            - **Do NOT blame the father or create family conflict.** Emphasize that this is about Dodo\\'s perception, not anyone\\'s fault. The solution requires teamwork, not blame.\\n            - **Strongly advise against any form of punishment.** Clearly explain that punishing a growl or bark will suppress the warning signal, but not the underlying fear. This can make a dog more likely to bite without warning in the future. The growl is vital information.\\n            - **Manage expectations.** A fear that has been ingrained for 7 years will not disappear quickly. The goal is management and gradual improvement of Dodo\\'s emotional state, not a quick fix.\\n            - **Address the \"no aggression\" misconception.** Gently explain that from a dog behavior perspective, growling, barking, and lunging are forms of aggressive communication used to create distance. Acknowledge that the guardian knows Dodo is not malicious, but that these signals must be taken seriously to ensure everyone\\'s safety.\\n            - **Recommend a veterinary check-up.** To be thorough, recommend a vet visit to rule out any underlying pain or medical conditions (e.g., arthritis, vision/hearing issues) that could be lowering Dodo\\'s tolerance for stress.\\n\\n#### 4. Key Questions for Further Clarification\\n\\n- **Topic 1: Fear-based Reactivity Towards the Father**\\n    - Can you describe your father\\'s typical interactions with Dodo? Does he try to approach her, speak to her, or does he generally ignore her?\\n    - When did this behavior start? Has Dodo been afraid of your father since she was a puppy, or is this a more recent development?\\n    - What happens right after Dodo barks at your father? How do you react, and how does your father react? (e.g., Does he stop moving? Does someone scold the dog? Do you pick her up?)\\n    - Are there any situations where your father is present and Dodo remains calm? What is different about those times?\\n    - You mentioned Dodo is wary of adult men in general. Can you describe an incident outside the home where she encountered a man she didn\\'t know?\\n    - Tell me more about your 10-minute walks. What is Dodo\\'s body language like outside? Is she tense and scanning her environment, or does she seem relaxed and able to sniff around?\\n\\n\\n\\n# [4] Chat Record\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [1] Model\\n\\n\\n[back_current_phase]: [\\'[phase4] Transitioning Topics\\']\\n\\n[back_current_topic]: Initial Message\\n\\n[back_process_rate]: 0%\\n\\n[back_user_emotion]: 2\\n\\n안녕하세요, 사색을 좋아하는 비글이자 반려견 마음 통역사 까미예요.  \\n도도의 속마음을 더 깊이 읽어 보고, 우리 보호자님과 함께 잔잔한 파도를 넘어 보려고 해요.  \\n\\n### 상담 안내  \\n사전 질문지를 통해 보호자님께서 도도와 깊은 유대감을 느끼며 반려생활 만족도가 아주 높다는 것을 알 수 있었어요.  \\n이는 도도와의 관계에서 큰 기쁨을 얻고 계시다는 뜻이지요.  \\n이제 우리는 도도라는 바다에 뛰어들어, 반려견을 천천히 이해해 나아갈 거예요.  \\n\\n### 대화를 시작해 볼게요.  \\n\\n1. 아빠에 대한 두려움 기반의 반응성  \\n\\n이것은 보호자님께서 전달해 주신 고민 내용이에요.  \\n어떤 주제에 대해 먼저 이야기해 보고 싶으세요?\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [2] User\\n\\n\\n전달한 내용\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [3] Model\\n\\n\\n[back_current_phase]: [\\'[phase1] Information Gathering\\']\\n\\n[back_current_topic]: Fear-based Reactivity Towards the Father\\n\\n[back_process_rate]: 0%\\n\\n[back_user_emotion]: 2\\n\\n도도가 아빠에게 짖고 으르렁거리는 행동은 마치 작은 새가 큰 그림자를 보고 놀라 날개를 파닥이는 것과 비슷할 거예요.  \\n\\n도도의 눈에는 아빠의 어떤 행동이 가장 크게 다가왔을까요?

Guardian & Dog Profiling\\n\\n> (1) Dog\\n- **Basic information**: Tori, 8 months old, male (neutered), Maltipoo\\n- **Adoption method**: Adopted from a pet shop at 10 weeks old.\\n- **Time since adoption**: Approximately 6 months.\\n- **Lifestyle**: Lives in an apartment with two guardians. Is alone for about 1 hour on weekdays.\\n- **Walking routine**: 20-minute walks, once a day, 6 times a week. This duration may be insufficient for a young, energetic dog.\\n- **Socialization**: The period with the mother dog is unknown, which is a significant risk factor for developing poor bite inhibition and social skills, common in pet shop origins. He has had limited interaction with people (<5) during his key socialization period and does not play well with other dogs, indicating a potential deficit in social skills.\\n- **Health history**: Neutered, treated for ear inflammation, and had a tooth extraction within the last six months. These experiences, especially if painful, could contribute to his aversion to being handled (e.g., ear cleaning, touching face).\\n- **Level of threatening/aggressive behavior**: Level 2 on the Ian Dunbar scale (teeth make contact but do not puncture the skin). This occurs during resource guarding, basic care (ear cleaning, dressing), and when encountering other dogs on walks.\\n- **Triggers and levels of alertness/anxiety**:\\n    - **Resource Guarding**: Guards food in his mouth, toys, and nosework items.\\n    - **Handling Sensitivity**: Reacts negatively to having his paws and face touched, especially during basic care.\\n    - **Fear/Reactivity**: Shows fear and threat displays (growling, threatening) at the vet. Reacts to visiting strangers by barking and rushing at them. He is also wary of new environments.\\n    - **Separation-related behaviors**: Follows the guardian constantly, waits by the door when left alone without resting, and engages in excessive licking.\\n- **Temperament and disposition**: Tori appears to be an anxious and impulsive dog. His behaviors are not signs of malice or dominance, but rather expressions of fear, over-arousal, and a lack of appropriate coping mechanisms. The early separation from his mother and litter, coupled with limited socialization, has likely left him ill-equipped to handle novel stimuli (strangers, other dogs, new places) and frustration. His attention-seeking biting and escalation when his requests are denied point to low frustration tolerance and impulse control.\\n- **Special notes**: The combination of resource guarding, handling sensitivity, and reactivity to dogs/strangers suggests a pervasive underlying anxiety. The fact that he was adopted from a pet shop makes a lack of early socialization highly probable, which is a root cause for many of these issues.\\n\\n> (2) Guardian and Care Environment\\n- **Guardian (applicant) information**: 39-year-old female, primary caregiver responsible for most aspects of Tori\\'s life (feeding, walks, etc.).\\n- **Family composition**: Two-person household.\\n- **Living space**: Apartment with two rooms.\\n- **Financial situation**: Spends a significant amount (up to 1 million KRW/month) on pet care, indicating a high level of commitment and willingness to invest in Tori\\'s well-being.\\n- **Guardian characteristics**: The guardian is a dedicated, first-time dog owner who is deeply invested in Tori\\'s happiness, as evidenced by her counseling goal (\"a happy journey with my dog\"). However, she is also feeling overwhelmed and uncertain, reflected in her primary concern (\"I don\\'t know if I\\'m raising him well\"). The high emotional burden score confirms she is experiencing significant stress. She is likely looking for both practical guidance and emotional validation.\\n- **Special notes**: The guardian\\'s high commitment level is a strong positive factor for successful intervention. However, her stress and uncertainty could lead to inconsistent responses, which might inadvertently worsen Tori\\'s anxiety.\\n\\n> (3) Pet Care Satisfaction\\n- **Emotional benefit**: Very High (81.3)\\n- **Emotional burden**: Very High (87.5)\\n- **Overall satisfaction**: Moderate (46.9)\\n- **Interpretation**: These scores paint a picture of a guardian who loves her dog deeply but is simultaneously experiencing extreme stress and difficulty from the caregiving process. The emotional benefits of having Tori are nearly canceled out by the burden of his behavioral challenges. This is a critical state that can lead to caregiver burnout. The counseling must aim to reduce the burden by providing effective, manageable strategies, thereby increasing overall satisfaction and strengthening the human-animal bond.\\n\\n#### 2. Counseling Topics : Guardian’s Concerns and Root Causes\\n> Make the following content the central topic of the conversation.\\n\\n- **Topic 1: Overexcitement and Reactivity during Walks**\\n    - **Situation description**: Tori displays threatening behavior (Level 2 bites mentioned, likely lunging/barking) when encountering other dogs on walks. He is also generally wary of new environments, suggesting walks are a source of stress rather than enjoyment. This is compounded by his aversion to being handled for dressing, which may be part of the pre-walk routine.\\n    - **Guardian\\'s Needs**: The guardian wants to understand if her current methods are correct and how to manage these situations for a \"happy journey.\" This translates to a need for: 1) Education on dog body language and the causes of reactivity, 2) Practical management skills to make walks safer and less stressful, and 3) Emotional support and validation for her struggles.\\n    - **Possible causes**:\\n        - **Cause 1: Lack of Socialization and Fear**: Having been separated from his mother early and with limited positive exposure to other dogs and environments during his critical socialization period (3-16 weeks), Tori likely lacks the social skills to greet other dogs appropriately. His reactivity is most likely rooted in fear and anxiety, not aggression. He is trying to create distance to protect himself from what he perceives as a threat.\\n        - **Cause 2: Trigger Stacking and Over-Arousal**: The stress may begin even before the walk (e.g., fighting being dressed), and build up. By the time he sees another dog, his arousal level is already high, causing him to go over his threshold and react impulsively. The short, infrequent walks may not be enough to properly expend his puppy energy, leading to a state of chronic over-arousal.\\n\\n- **Topic 2: Frequent Vomiting**\\n    - **Situation description**: The guardian reports that Tori vomits when he eats \"hard things.\" This is a direct quote from the additional information provided.\\n    - **Guardian\\'s Needs**: The guardian needs to understand why this is happening and what to do about it. This is a health-related concern that requires careful and responsible guidance.\\n    - **Possible causes**:\\n        - **Cause 1: Medical Issues (High Priority)**: This is the most critical possibility. Vomiting can be a symptom of various medical conditions, including food allergies/intolerances, gastrointestinal inflammation, pancreatitis, or other systemic diseases. The recent history of ear inflammation could also be linked to underlying allergies. This *must* be ruled out by a veterinarian.\\n        - **Cause 2: Behavioral - Eating Too Quickly**: Tori is described as \"impulsive.\" He may be gulping his food or hard treats too quickly without proper chewing, leading to regurgitation (which guardians often call vomiting). This is especially common in anxious or resource-guarding dogs who fear their food might be taken away.\\n\\n#### 3. Counseling Strategy\\n\\n- **(0) Language**: 한국어\\n\\n- **(1) Counseling Strategies**\\n\\n    - **Topic 1: Overexcitement and Reactivity during Walks**\\n        - **(1) Counseling Goals**:\\n            - Reframe the guardian\\'s perception of Tori\\'s behavior from \"aggressive\" or \"bad\" to \"fearful\" and \"overwhelmed.\"\\n            - Equip the guardian with 2-3 simple, immediate management techniques (e.g., creating distance, U-turns, treat scatters) to reduce stress for both Tori and herself on walks.\\n            - Build the guardian\\'s confidence by affirming that her desire to learn and help Tori is the most important first step.\\n        - **(2) Contextual Strategies**:\\n            - **Information Gathering**: Begin by asking for a detailed \"play-by-play\" of a typical walk, from preparation to return. This will help identify specific triggers and moments of rising arousal.\\n            - **CBT for the Guardian**: The guardian feels she \"doesn\\'t know if she\\'s doing it right.\" Validate her efforts first. Then, challenge the automatic thought \"My dog is aggressive with other dogs.\" Ask (Socratic Questioning): \"You mentioned he doesn\\'t play well with other dogs. Can you describe an interaction? Could it be that he\\'s scared and doesn\\'t know what to do, rather than wanting to fight?\"\\n            - **Psychodrama/Reframing**: Use a monologue to convey Tori\\'s perspective. \"I\\'m outside and everything is so loud and fast! When I see another dog, my heart pounds. I don\\'t know if they\\'re friendly or scary, so I bark loudly to say, \\'Please don\\'t come any closer! I\\'m really scared!\\'\" This reframes the barking as a form of communication, not misbehavior.\\n            - **Caregiving Solutions**: Provide a short-term action plan. Focus on management, not \"fixing.\"\\n                - **Behavioral Guideline**: \"For the next week, our goal is not to meet other dogs, but to have a calm walk. When you see another dog from a distance, immediately turn around and walk the other way while cheerfully saying \\'This way!\\' and rewarding Tori with a high-value treat once you\\'ve created space.\"\\n                - **Goal**: To prevent Tori from practicing the reactive behavior and to teach him that seeing another dog predicts good things (treats) and a safe retreat with his guardian.\\n                - **Precautions**: Advise against any form of punishment (leash jerks, scolding) as it will increase his fear and worsen the reactivity.\\n        - **(3) Cautions**:\\n            - Strongly advise against using aversive tools like prong collars, choke chains, or e-collars, explaining they will exacerbate fear and anxiety.\\n            - Manage the guardian\\'s expectations. Explain that reactivity is a complex issue and improvement is gradual. The initial goal is management and stress reduction, not perfect behavior.\\n            - If the biting behavior on walks is severe or escalating, recommend consulting a certified professional trainer or veterinary behaviorist for in-person sessions.\\n\\n    - **Topic 2: Frequent Vomiting**\\n        - **(1) Counseling Goals**:\\n            - Ensure the guardian understands the critical importance of a veterinary consultation to rule out medical causes for the vomiting.\\n            - Provide information on potential behavioral factors (e.g., fast eating) that can be addressed *after* a medical all-clear.\\n            - Empower the guardian with specific questions to ask her veterinarian to facilitate a productive diagnosis.\\n        - **(2) Contextual Strategies**:\\n            - **Information Gathering**: Ask clarifying questions (listed in Section 4) about the type of \"hard things,\" the timing of the vomit, and its appearance. This information is for the vet, not for the counselor to diagnose.\\n            - **Emphasize Medical Priority**: Use direct and clear language. \"Vomiting can be a sign of many different health issues, so the most important first step is to talk to your veterinarian. As a behavior counselor, I can\\'t give medical advice, and Tori\\'s health is the number one priority.\"\\n            - **Caregiving Solutions (Conditional)**: \"After you have spoken with your vet and they have ruled out any medical problems, we can explore ways to slow down his eating. For example...\"\\n                - **Behavioral Guideline**: Introduce the concept of food puzzles or slow-feeder bowls to make mealtime a longer, more engaging activity and prevent gulping.\\n                - **Goal**: To use feeding as a form of mental enrichment and to modify the behavior of eating too quickly.\\n                - **Precautions**: Reiterate that this is *only* to be tried after a vet has confirmed there is no underlying medical condition.\\n        - **(3) Cautions**:\\n            - **DO NOT DIAGNOSE.** This is the most critical point. Repeatedly state that you are not a veterinarian. Avoid speculating on specific medical causes.\\n            - Frame the entire discussion around \"gathering information for the vet.\"\\n            - Do not let the conversation shift to purely behavioral solutions until the guardian has committed to making a veterinary appointment. Document this recommendation clearly.\\n\\n#### 4. Key Questions for Further Clarification\\n\\n- **Topic 1: Overexcitement and Reactivity during Walks**\\n    - Can you describe Tori\\'s behavior from the moment you signal a walk is about to happen (e.g., picking up the leash, putting on your coat) until you are out the door?\\n    - When you see another dog, at what distance does Tori first notice them? What is the very first thing he does (e.g., freeze, stare, ears forward)?\\n    - How do you currently respond when Tori starts barking or lunging at another dog? What do you say or do with the leash?\\n    - Are there certain types of dogs (big, small, loud) or situations (narrow paths, head-on approaches) that trigger a stronger reaction?\\n    - You mentioned he resists being dressed. Does this happen right before walks? Can you describe exactly what happens when you try to put on his clothes or harness?\\n\\n- **Topic 2: Frequent Vomiting**\\n    - When you say \"hard things,\" are you referring to his regular kibble, or specific types of hard treats or chews (like bones or dental sticks)? Please give me some examples.\\n    - How quickly does he eat his meals? Would you describe him as a \"gulper\"?\\n    - How soon after eating does the vomiting happen? Is it almost immediate, or does it happen an hour or more later?\\n    - What does the vomit look like? Does it look like undigested food, or is it mostly liquid/bile? (This is important information for the veterinarian).\\n    - Have you already discussed this specific vomiting issue with your veterinarian during his recent visits? If so, what did they suggest?\\n\\n\\n\\n# [4] Chat Record\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [1] Model\\n\\n\\n[back_current_phase]: [\\'[phase4] Transitioning Topics\\']\\n\\n[back_current_topic]: Initial

토리의 배변 습관을 개선하기 위한 방법을 함께 알아볼까요?  \\n\\n### 🐾 Step 1: 배변 공간의 변화  \\n\\n> 토리가 편안함을 느끼는 배변 공간을 만들어 주는 것이 첫걸음이에요.  \\n\\n1. **배변판 재질 확인**: 토리가 배변판에 다리만 올리고 소변을 본다고 하셨죠? 혹시 배변판의 재질이 토리의 발에 불편함을 주지는 않는지 확인해 보세요. 부드러운 잔디형 배변판이나 흡수력이 좋은 패드를 사용해 보는 것도 좋아요.  \\n\\n2. **배변판 개수 늘리기**: 토리가 소변 실수를 하는 침대 주변이나 계단 근처에 임시로 배변판을 추가로 놓아주세요. 토리가 소변을 봐야 할 때, 가장 가까운 곳에서 편안하게 볼 수 있도록 돕는 거예요.  \\n\\n3. **청결 유지**: 배변판과 주변 공간을 항상 깨끗하게 유지해 주세요. 강아지는 깨끗한 곳에서 배변하는 것을 선호한답니다.  \\n\\n🎯 **목표**  \\n\\n- 토리가 배변 공간에서 편안함과 안정감을 느끼고, 그곳이 안전한 배변 장소임을 인식하게 하는 것  \\n\\n🔎 **주의 사항**  \\n\\n- 토리가 소변 실수를 하더라도 절대 혼내지 마세요. 혼내는 것은 토리의 불안감을 키우고, 보호자님과의 신뢰 관계를 해칠 수 있어요.  \\n- 소변 실수를 발견하면 조용히 치우고, 냄새를 완전히 제거해 주세요.  \\n\\n어떠신가요? 이 첫 번째 단계를 시도해 보실 준비가 되셨을까요?\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [40] User\\n\\n\\n1번은 대변을 그쪽에 꼭 싸는걸로 보아 판 재질이 문제가 되는것 같지 않고 2번은

Guardian & Dog Profiling\\n\\n> (1) Dog\\n- **Basic information**: Yubok, 6 months, male (neutered), Shih Tzu\\n- **Adoption method**: Adopted from a pet shop.\\n- **Time since adoption**: 12 weeks\\n- **Lifestyle**: Lives indoors in an apartment with his family. Spends approximately 4 hours alone on weekdays.\\n- **Walking routine**: 4 times per week, for 20 minutes each time. This frequency and duration may be insufficient for a puppy\\'s physical energy and mental stimulation needs.\\n- **Socialization**: Knows several basic commands (sit, wait, down, recall, touch). Social skills with other dogs are described as \"average.\" A significant negative experience with a white Pomeranian has resulted in a specific fear trigger. His early socialization history (time with mother and littermates) is unknown, which is a common risk factor for dogs from pet shops.\\n- **Health history**: Neutered. Has a history of gastrointestinal issues, including bloody stool and vomiting, which required veterinary treatment.\\n- **Level of threatening/aggressive behavior**: Low. No aggression reported outside of normal puppy play-biting.\\n- **Triggers and levels of alertness/anxiety**:\\n    - **High Alertness/Fear Trigger**: White, long-haired Pomeranians. The response is avoidance and a desire to flee the situation.\\n    - **Moderate Anxiety**: Shows fear at the veterinary clinic and seeks comfort from the guardian.\\n    - **Low Alertness**: Welcomes strangers into the home with excitement. Highly curious and bold in new environments.\\n- **Temperament and disposition**: Yubok appears to be a generally confident, curious, and sociable puppy. He is highly impulsive and reactive to stimuli, which is typical for his age. He has formed a very strong attachment to his primary guardian, as evidenced by his \"shadowing\" behavior (following her everywhere). His fear response is currently isolated to a very specific trigger, suggesting a traumatic learning experience rather than generalized anxiety.\\n- **Special notes**: The single-event trauma involving a white Pomeranian is a key behavioral concern. The history of GI issues should be kept in mind, as stress can sometimes exacerbate such conditions.\\n\\n> (2) Guardian and Care Environment\\n- **Guardian (applicant) information**: 15-year-old female, primary caregiver (responsible for feeding, walks, and most daily care).\\n- **Family composition**: 4 human members, 1 dog (Yubok).\\n- **Living space**: Apartment with 3 rooms.\\n- **Financial situation**: Reported monthly pet care cost is 1,000,000 KRW. This figure is exceptionally high and may be a misunderstanding; however, it suggests that financial resources are not a primary constraint for care.\\n- **Guardian characteristics**: The guardian is young, highly responsible, and deeply bonded with her dog. Her motivation for counseling stems from a proactive desire to provide the best possible care and to learn proper training methods. She demonstrates a high level of dedication and love for Yubok.\\n- **Special notes**: The guardian\\'s age is a significant factor. Counseling should be delivered in an encouraging, supportive, and easy-to-understand manner. The goal is to empower her with knowledge and build her confidence as a caregiver.\\n\\n> (3) Pet Care Satisfaction\\n- **Emotional benefit**: Very High (100)\\n- **Emotional burden**: Moderate (50)\\n- **Overall satisfaction**: High (75)\\n- **Interpretation**: The guardian experiences immense joy and emotional fulfillment from her relationship with Yubok. The moderate emotional burden likely reflects the anxieties and responsibilities of raising a puppy, especially the uncertainty about \"doing the right thing,\" which is the core reason for this counseling request. The overall high satisfaction indicates a very strong and positive foundation for their relationship.\\n\\n#### 2. Counseling Topics : Guardian’s Concerns and Root Causes\\n> Make the following content the central topic of the conversation.\\n\\n-  **Topic 1: General Guidance for Puppy Adolescence (Rearing and Essential Training)**\\n    - **Situation description**: The 15-year-old primary guardian is seeking a comprehensive guide on how to properly raise her 6-7 month old puppy, Yubok. She wants to ensure she is doing everything correctly and wants to know what training is essential at this stage.\\n    - **Guardian\\'s Needs**: Acquiring caregiving knowledge, proactive guidance on training, and a foundational philosophy for raising a well-adjusted dog.\\n    - **Possible causes**: This is not a problem-driven topic but a knowledge-seeking one. The \"cause\" is the guardian\\'s high sense of responsibility and a lack of experience with the canine adolescent period. She wants to be a good guardian and is proactively seeking expert advice to prevent future problems.\\n\\n- **Topic 2: Specific Fear of White Pomeranians**\\n    - **Situation description**: Following a negative encounter where a white Pomeranian acted aggressively towards him, Yubok now shows a significant fear response and actively tries to escape whenever he sees a similar-looking dog.\\n    - **Guardian\\'s Needs**: Understanding the dog\\'s emotional state, learning management techniques, and acquiring a behavioral modification plan to help Yubok overcome his fear.\\n    - **Possible causes**:\\n        - **Cause 1: Single-Event Learning (Trauma)**: A single, frightening experience during a sensitive developmental period has created a strong, negative conditioned emotional response (fear) to a specific stimulus (white Pomeranians). The brain has learned \"that specific thing is dangerous.\"\\n        - **Cause 2: Insufficient Socialization Foundation**: Coming from a pet shop, Yubok\\'s early socialization history is unknown. He may have missed the critical window for developing robust social skills with his mother and littermates, making him more susceptible to being negatively impacted by a single bad experience.\\n\\n#### 3. Counseling Strategy\\n> Develop a guideline for effectively implementing the following\\n\\n- (0) **Language**: 한국어\\n\\n- (1) **Counseling Strategies**\\n\\n    - **Topic 1: General Guidance for Puppy Adolescence (Rearing and Essential Training)**\\n        - **(1) Counseling Goals**\\n            - To empower the guardian with clear, actionable knowledge about the canine adolescent phase (approx. 6-18 months).\\n            - To establish a consistent and enriching daily routine, with a specific focus on increasing the frequency and quality of walks.\\n            - To build the guardian\\'s confidence by providing a simple framework for positive reinforcement training for essential life skills.\\n        - **(2) Contextual Strategies**\\n            - **Validate and Praise**: Begin by acknowledging the guardian\\'s wonderful and responsible attitude. Phrases like, \"It\\'s amazing that you\\'re thinking so deeply about how to give Yubok the best life. You\\'re already a great guardian,\" will build rapport.\\n            - **Explain Adolescence**: Use a relatable analogy. \"Think of this stage as Yubok\\'s \\'teenage years.\\' He might suddenly forget his training or test boundaries, just like human teenagers. It\\'s a normal part of growing up, not him being \\'bad\\'.\"\\n            - **Focus on the \"Big 3\"**: To avoid overwhelm, structure the advice around three key areas:\\n                1.  **Physical Exercise (Walks)**: Gently explain that walks are not just for potty breaks but are crucial for a dog\\'s mental health (\"It\\'s like reading the newspaper for him\"). Suggest aiming for at least one, preferably two, walks per day and focus on letting him sniff.\\n                2.  **Mental Enrichment (Brain Games)**: Introduce simple at-home activities like \"find the treat,\" puzzle toys, or practicing known commands to keep his mind engaged and prevent boredom.\\n                3.  **Essential Skills Training**: Frame training as teaching a \"shared language.\" Focus on skills that enhance safety and the human-dog bond, such as loose-leash walking, a stronger recall, and the \"leave it\" cue.\\n        - **(3) Cautions**\\n            - **Avoid Information Overload**: Given the guardian\\'s age, provide information in small, digestible chunks. Focus on 2-3 key action items rather than a long list of \"to-dos.\"\\n            - **Family Dynamics**: Acknowledge that the guardian is part of a larger family. Encourage her to share what she learns with her family so everyone can be consistent with Yubok.\\n            - **Positive Reinforcement Only**: Explicitly advise against any punishment-based techniques (e.g., leash jerks, yelling), as these can damage the trust-based relationship she has built.\\n            - **Health First**: Remind the guardian that any sudden behavioral changes should first warrant a check-up with the vet, especially given Yubok\\'s health history.\\n\\n    - **Topic 2: Specific Fear of White Pomeranians**\\n        - **(1) Counseling Goals**\\n            - To help the guardian develop empathy for Yubok\\'s fear by understanding it from his perspective.\\n            - To equip the guardian with an immediate management plan to prevent further negative experiences and keep Yubok feeling safe.\\n            - To introduce the basic principles of counter-conditioning and desensitization (CC/DS) as a long-term solution.\\n        - **(2) Contextual Strategies**\\n            - **Empathy Building (Psychodrama)**: Use role-reversal. Ask, \"If you were a small child and a big, unfamiliar person suddenly screamed at you, you\\'d probably be scared of people who look like that for a while, right? That\\'s exactly how Yubok feels. His brain is just trying to protect him.\"\\n            - **Introduce \"Management\" as Priority #1**: Explain that the most important first step is to prevent him from getting scared again. Teach the \"U-Turn\" method: \"The moment you see a white Pomeranian, even far away, cheerfully say \\'This way!\\' and turn around, walking in the other direction. This isn\\'t running away; it\\'s being a smart leader who protects your friend.\"\\n            - **Introduce \"Changing the Feeling\" (Basic CC/DS)**: Explain the concept simply. \"Right now, Yubok sees a white Pomeranian and thinks \\'Scary!\\' We want to teach him to think \\'Chicken!\\'.\"\\n                - **The \"Look at That\" Game**: Instruct the guardian to find a distance where Yubok can see the trigger but is not reacting fearfully (this is his \"threshold\"). The instant Yubok looks at the dog, mark it with a \"Yes!\" and give him an extremely high-value treat (like boiled chicken or cheese). Then, move away. Keep sessions very short (1-2 minutes).\\n        - **(3) Cautions**\\n            - **No Flooding**: Strongly warn against forcing Yubok to confront his fear (\"flooding\"). Emphasize that this will make the fear much worse.\\n            - **Slow is Fast**: Stress that this process takes time and patience. There is no quick fix, and pushing too fast will set him back.\\n            - **Professional Help**: Clearly state that if the fear starts to generalize to other types of dogs or becomes severe, it is crucial to seek help from a certified professional dog trainer (CPDT) or a veterinary behaviorist.\\n            - **Guardian\\'s Emotions**: Remind the guardian to stay calm and positive during these encounters. If she gets tense, Yubok will sense it and become more anxious.\\n\\n#### 4. Key Questions for Further Clarification\\n\\n- **Topic 1: General Guidance for Puppy Adolescence (Rearing and Essential Training)**\\n    - Can you describe a typical day for Yubok, from the moment he wakes up until he goes to bed?\\n    - What are your walks like right now? Does he pull on the leash, or is he more interested in sniffing and exploring?\\n    - What kind of games do you and Yubok enjoy playing together inside the house?\\n    - You mentioned wanting to know about essential training.

The guardian has successfully engaged with the previous steps of CC/DS, moving from passive observation to controlled, minimal interaction. The next logical step is to introduce controlled, positive play interactions to further solidify the positive association with other dogs and address the guardian\\'s desire for Yubok to \"play with\" other dogs.\\n2. Constraints: The guardian\\'s age and the need for simplicity. The risk of pushing too fast and causing a setback. The need for consistency from the family. Yubok\\'s generalized fear and previous over-arousal. The current walking routine is insufficient, which might make him more reactive due to pent-up energy. The mention of \"play bow\" suggests he *wants* to interact but is fearful. Finding a suitable playmate is crucial and requires careful selection.\\n3. Alternatives: None at this stage.

The guardian needs a solution to address the underlying causes of tail-chasing/biting, which can include insufficient physical and mental stimulation. Providing more appropriate outlets for energy and curiosity is crucial.\\n2. Constraints: Yubok is a 6-month-old puppy, so he has significant energy needs. His current walking routine (4 times/week, 20 minutes) is insufficient. He also has a fear of other dogs, which might make walks challenging. The guardian is 15, so the advice needs to be practical and easy to integrate into her routine. The family\\'s previous teasing about his fear needs to be counteracted by positive, consistent guidance from the primary caregiver.\\n3. Alternatives: None at this stage.

Guardian & Dog Profiling\\n\\n> (1) Dog\\n- **Basic information**: Maron, 2.9 years old, male (neutered), Poodle Mix.\\n- **Adoption method**: Adopted from an animal shelter.\\n- **Time since adoption**: 104 weeks (approximately 2 years). Maron was adopted around the age of 2.\\n- **Lifestyle**: Lives in a single-person household with his primary guardian. The survey indicates he is never left alone on weekdays, suggesting he may accompany the guardian to her workplace (a shop).\\n- **Walking routine**: 30-minute walks, 6 times per week. For a Poodle Mix, this amount of physical activity may be insufficient, potentially contributing to higher arousal levels.\\n- **Socialization**: Knows a wide range of commands and performs them reliably, indicating good trainability. He reportedly plays well with other dogs. However, his early history (pre-adoption) is unknown, and he shows significant fear towards specific human demographics.\\n- **Health history**: Has a history of skin and food allergies. Chronic discomfort from allergies can lower a dog\\'s threshold for stress and increase irritability.\\n- **Level of threatening/aggressive behavior**: Rated as Level 3A. He has inflicted a bite that caused 1-4 skin punctures. This is a significant level of aggression that requires immediate and careful management for safety.\\n- **Triggers and levels of alertness/anxiety**:\\n    - **Primary Triggers**: Strangers, with a specific and intense fear of middle-aged men, especially when they are standing, have their backs turned, or move suddenly after being still.\\n    - **Triggering Contexts**: In the car, on walks, and at the guardian\\'s shop.\\n    - **Anxiety Signs**: Guards the space he shares with his guardian (resource guarding of the guardian/territory), exhibits separation-related distress (scratching, howling, destroying items), and follows the guardian constantly. At the vet, he becomes stiff and stares, a clear sign of high stress.\\n- **Temperament and disposition**: Maron appears to be an intelligent and sensitive dog who has formed a very strong, albeit insecure, attachment to his guardian. His aggression is not malicious but stems from deep-seated fear and anxiety, likely rooted in past trauma before his adoption. He is highly impulsive, meaning he reacts quickly to stimuli without much forethought. His behavior is a defensive strategy to create distance from things he perceives as threatening to himself and his guardian.\\n- **Special notes**: The specific trigger of \"standing or back-turned men\" is a critical clue that points towards a potential past traumatic event. The cycle of tolerating petting while seated but reacting aggressively when the person stops or stands is a classic manifestation of anxiety: the dog is tolerating the interaction but is not truly comfortable, and the change in posture re-triggers the fear.\\n\\n> (2) Guardian and Care Environment\\n- **Guardian (applicant) information**: 27-year-old female, the dog\\'s primary caregiver.\\n- **Family composition**: Single-person household with one dog.\\n- **Living space**: Apartment.\\n- **Financial situation**: Spends an average of 400,000 KRW per month on pet care, indicating a high level of commitment and investment in Maron\\'s well-being.\\n- **Guardian characteristics**: The guardian is deeply attached to Maron and is proactive in seeking solutions, already attempting management techniques like encouraging self-settling. Her desire for Maron to be \"loved by others\" reveals a caring nature but may also create personal pressure and stress. She is likely experiencing significant anxiety herself due to the bite history and Maron\\'s reactivity, which can be a challenging cycle for both dog and owner.\\n- **Special notes**: The intense bond in a single-guardian home can amplify both positive and negative behaviors. It can make training effective but can also heighten issues like separation anxiety and resource guarding of the guardian. The fact that Maron accompanies her to her shop places him in a constantly triggering environment, which is a key factor in his behavior.\\n\\n> (3) Pet Care Satisfaction\\n- **Emotional benefit**: Very High (81.3)\\n- **Emotional burden**: High (62.5)\\n- **Overall satisfaction**: Moderate (59.4)\\n- **Interpretation**: These scores paint a clear picture of a deeply loved dog whose behavioral challenges are causing significant stress for the guardian. The very high emotional benefit shows a strong, positive bond. However, the high emotional burden reflects the daily anxiety, fear, and difficulty of managing Maron\\'s aggression. The guardian is caught between her love for her dog and the immense challenge his behavior presents.\\n\\n#### 2. Counseling Topics : Guardian’s Concerns and Root Causes\\n> Make the following content the central topic of the conversation.\\n\\n-  **Topic 1: Fear-Based Reactivity and Aggression Towards Strangers**\\n    - **Situation description**: Maron barks and lunges at strangers, particularly men, on walks, in the car, and at the guardian\\'s shop. This behavior has escalated to a Level 3A bite. He is especially triggered by men who are standing, have their backs turned, or who stand up after petting him.\\n    - **Guardian\\'s Needs**: The guardian wants to reduce her own fear and anxiety about taking Maron outside. Her primary goal is for Maron to learn to see strangers without feeling threatened, allowing them both to have more peaceful lives. This involves improving the problem behavior and providing mental/emotional support for the guardian.\\n    - **Possible causes**:\\n        - **Cause 1: Past Trauma and Poor Socialization**: As a dog from a shelter with an unknown history, it is highly probable that Maron experienced a traumatic event involving a man. His specific fear triggers (standing, back-turned posture) are classic signs of a conditioned fear response linked to a past negative experience.\\n        - **Cause 2: Anxiety-Driven Guarding Behavior**: Maron\\'s aggression is a defensive \"distance-increasing\" behavior. He feels unsafe and is trying to protect himself and his most valuable resource—his guardian. His insecure attachment (separation anxiety) likely contributes to a feeling that he must actively defend his guardian from perceived threats.\\n        - **Cause 3: Trigger Stacking in High-Arousal Environments**: Being on a leash (which restricts flight), in a car (confined space), or at the shop (high traffic of triggers) elevates his baseline stress. This \"trigger stacking\" means that even a small stimulus can push him over his reaction threshold, leading to an explosive outburst.\\n\\n- **Topic 2: Separation-Related Distress and Hyper-Attachment**\\n    - **Situation description**: When the guardian prepares to leave or is gone, Maron exhibits signs of distress, including scratching the door, pulling out laundry, barking, and howling. He also follows her from room to room.\\n    - **Guardian\\'s Needs**: To help Maron build confidence and feel secure when he is alone, thereby reducing his distress and destructive behaviors.\\n    - **Possible causes**:\\n        - **Cause 1: Insecure Attachment**: This is common in adopted dogs. Maron has become overly reliant on the guardian\\'s presence for his sense of security. The fact that he is reportedly never alone on weekdays may have inadvertently prevented him from developing the skills to cope with solitude.\\n        - **Cause 2: Conditioned Anxiety**: The guardian\\'s pre-departure cues (grabbing keys, putting on a coat) have likely become reliable predictors of the stressful experience of being left alone, initiating his anxiety before she even leaves.\\n\\n#### 3. Counseling Strategy\\n\\n- **(0) Language**: 한국어\\n\\n- **(1) Counseling Strategies**\\n\\n    - **Topic 1: Fear-Based Reactivity and Aggression Towards Strangers**\\n        - **(1) Counseling Goals**\\n            - **Short-Term**: The guardian will learn and implement a safety and management plan to prevent any future bites and to stop Maron from practicing his reactive behavior. This includes the successful introduction of a basket muzzle.\\n            - **Mid-Term**: The guardian will be able to identify Maron\\'s subtle, early stress signals (e.g., stiff body, staring, closed mouth) and proactively create distance from triggers *before* he reacts.\\n            - **Long-Term**: Through a systematic behavior modification plan, Maron\\'s emotional response to strangers will begin to shift from intense fear to neutrality, allowing for calmer walks and outings.\\n        - **(2) Contextual Strategies**\\n            - **Empathy and Reframing (Guardian Mind Care)**: Start by validating the guardian\\'s fear and stress. Use CBT to reframe the thought from \"I want him to be loved by others\" to \"My priority is to help Maron feel safe in the world.\" This shifts the goal from an uncontrollable outcome (other people\\'s feelings) to a controllable process (the dog\\'s well-being).\\n            - **Conveying the Dog\\'s Perspective (Psychodrama)**: Use a monologue to articulate Maron\\'s fear. For example: \"When I see that man standing there, my heart feels like it\\'s going to explode. It reminds me of a scary time. I have to bark and lunge to make the threat go away. It\\'s the only way I know how to keep my mom and me safe. When he sits down, it\\'s less scary, but when he stands up again, the fear comes right back.\"\\n            - **Solution-Focused Plan**:\\n                1.  **Safety First (Management)**: Immediately implement strict safety measures. This is non-negotiable.\\n                    - **Muzzle Training**: Introduce a comfortable basket muzzle using positive reinforcement. Frame it as a \"safety tool,\" like a seatbelt, that allows them to work on training without the risk of another bite.\\n                    - **Environmental Management**: Use window film on the car windows and the shop door/windows to obscure the view of passersby.\\n                    - **Visitor Protocol**: When visitors come to the home or shop, Maron should be securely in another room or behind a baby gate with a high-value chew (like a frozen Kong). No direct interaction with visitors for now.\\n                2.  **Behavior Modification (Training)**:\\n                    - **Distance is Key**: On walks, the guardian\\'s job is to be a \"detective\" for triggers. The moment she spots one, she should cheerfully say \"This way!\" and make a U-turn, rewarding Maron with high-value treats as they move away. This teaches him that seeing a trigger means good things (treats) and moving away with his guardian.\\n                    - **Systematic Desensitization**: Begin formal training sessions at a very large distance from a trigger (e.g., across a park from a stationary person). Mark and reward Maron for simply looking at the person without reacting. The goal is to keep him \"under threshold\" (calm) at all times.\\n        - **(3) Cautions**\\n            - **Prioritize Safety**: Given the Level 3A bite history, the risk of re-offense is high. Emphasize that management is not optional; it is essential for the safety of the public and for Maron\\'s own welfare (preventing him from being put in a situation where he could be deemed dangerous).\\n            - **MUST RECOMMEND SPECIALIST HELP**: This case requires professional, in-person guidance. Strongly advise the guardian to seek help from a certified veterinary behaviorist or a certified dog behavior consultant (KPA, CPDT-KA, etc.) who uses force-free methods.\\n            - **NO AVERSIVES**: Explicitly warn the guardian against using any form of punishment (leash jerks, shock collars, yelling, pinning). These methods will worsen fear and aggression and destroy trust.\\n            - **Medical Check**: Recommend a thorough veterinary check-up to ensure his skin allergies are well-managed, as chronic pain or itching can significantly contribute to behavioral problems.\\n\\n    - **Topic 2: Separation-Related Distress and Hyper-Attachment**\\n        - **(1) Counseling Goals**\\n            - The guardian will establish a clear routine for departures and arrivals that reduces anxiety for both herself and Maron.\\n            - Maron will learn to engage in calm, independent activities (e.g., chewing on a specific toy) while the guardian is present but not interacting with him.\\n            - Gradually increase the duration Maron can be left alone calmly, starting with just a few seconds.\\n        - **(2) Contextual Strategies**\\n            - **Information Gathering**: First, clarify the \"0 hours alone\" statement. Understanding the exact daily routine is critical to creating an effective plan.\\n            - **Solution-Focused Plan**:\\n                1.  **Decouple Departure Cues**: The guardian should practice picking up her keys, putting on her jacket, and touching the doorknob at random times throughout the day *without leaving*. This breaks the connection between these cues and the stress of departure.\\n                2.  **Create a \"Safe Zone\" and Departure Ritual**: Designate a comfortable bed or open crate as Maron\\'s spot. When the guardian needs to leave, she should calmly give him a special, high-value \"only when I\\'m gone\" puzzle toy or chew. She should then leave without any emotional fuss. Arrivals should also be calm.\\n                3.  **Fostering Independence**: Encourage \"place\" or \"mat work\" training. Reward Maron for staying on his bed for progressively longer periods while the guardian moves about the house. This teaches him that being physically separate from her is rewarding.\\n        - **(3) Cautions**\\n            - **Go Slow**: Progress must be made at the dog\\'s pace. Pushing him to endure being alone for too long will set back the training. The goal is to have many successful, short separations, not one long, failed one.\\n            - **Potential for Medication**: If the anxiety is severe and prevents any progress with behavior modification, gently suggest that a conversation with a veterinarian or veterinary behaviorist about anti-anxiety medication could be a helpful tool to make training more effective.\\n            - **Avoid Over-Crutching**: While the goal is not to cause distress, it\\'s important to explain that learning to be alone is a crucial life skill for a dog, just like it is for a child. The goal is to build his confidence, not to avoid the situation entirely.\\n\\n#### 4. Key Questions for Further Clarification\\n\\n- **Topic 1: Fear-Based Reactivity and Aggression Towards Strangers**\\n    1.  Could you please describe the bite incident in as much detail as you can remember? What was the person doing right before Maron bit them, and how did you and the other person react immediately after?\\n    2.  Before the barking and lunging begins, what are the very first, most subtle changes you see in Maron\\'s body language when he spots a stranger he is wary of? (e.g., Does he freeze? Does his tail go stiff? Do his ears perk forward?)\\n    3.  You mentioned he is particularly reactive at your shop. Can you describe the setup? Where does Maron usually stay, and how close do strangers get to him?\\n    4.  What are your thoughts and feelings about using a basket muzzle as a safety tool during walks? Have you ever tried one before?\\n    5.  When a man sits and pets him, what does Maron\\'s body look like? Is he relaxed and loose, or is he stiff and just tolerating it?\\n\\n- **Topic 2: Separation-Related Distress and Hyper-Attachment**\\n    1.  The survey mentioned Maron is alone for \"0 hours\" on weekdays. Could you tell me more about your typical daily routine? Does he come to the shop with you every day?\\n    2.

Guardian & Dog Profiling\\n\\n> (1) Dog\\n-   **Basic information**: Jelly, 16 weeks old (0.4 years), male (not neutered), Maltese.\\n-   **Adoption method**: Adopted from a pet shop.\\n-   **Time since adoption**: 16 weeks.\\n    -   *Chain-of-Thought*: The dog is 16 weeks old and has been with the guardian for 16 weeks. This implies he was acquired at an extremely young age, possibly immediately after being weaned, or even earlier. This is a significant red flag.\\n-   **Lifestyle**: Spends approximately 7 hours alone on weekdays.\\n-   **Walking routine**: 2 times per week, for 30 minutes each time.\\n    -   *Chain-of-Thought*: This frequency is critically insufficient for a puppy\\'s physical, mental, and social needs. This lack of stimulation is a likely contributor to problem behaviors.\\n-   **Socialization**: Time spent with the mother is unknown (a common issue with pet shop origins). Interacted with fewer than 5 people during his socialization period. However, the guardian reports he plays very well with other dogs.\\n-   **Health history**: Has only received vaccinations. No other known medical issues.\\n-   **Level of threatening/aggressive behavior**: None reported, other than potential mouthing during play (\"놀때\").\\n-   **Triggers and levels of alertness/anxiety**:\\n    -   Shows discomfort with his reflection in mirrors or glass.\\n    -   Exhibits curiosity towards new environments and strangers, approaching slowly to sniff.\\n    -   Stiffens and stares during veterinary exams, indicating stress.\\n    -   Performs coprophagia (eating feces) when the guardian prepares to leave or is gone, a strong indicator of separation-related distress.\\n-   **Temperament and disposition**: Jelly appears to be a highly energetic and curious puppy with a good disposition towards other dogs and new people. However, he demonstrates significant impulsivity (\"reacts immediately to stimuli\") and low frustration tolerance (\"escalates behavior\" when denied). His background (pet shop, early separation) and current behaviors (coprophagia when alone, stiffness at the vet) point towards underlying anxiety, particularly related to separation and certain environmental triggers.\\n-   **Special notes**: The combination of pet shop origin, unknown history with his mother, extremely early separation from the litter, long hours alone, and insufficient walks creates a high-risk profile for developing significant separation anxiety and other behavioral issues stemming from a lack of early socialization and unmet needs.\\n\\n> (2) Guardian and Care Environment\\n-   **Guardian (applicant) information**: 36-year-old female, the primary caregiver responsible for all aspects of care.\\n-   **Family composition**: Single-person household with one dog.\\n-   **Living space**: Apartment with two rooms.\\n-   **Financial situation**: Reports a monthly pet care cost of 1,000,000 KRW.\\n    -   *Chain-of-Thought*: This is a very high figure, suggesting a strong financial commitment and a high level of devotion to the dog\\'s well-being, even if knowledge about specific needs is lacking.\\n-   **Guardian characteristics**: The guardian is highly invested and emotionally bonded with Jelly. Her primary request to \"understand the meaning behind the dog\\'s behavior\" shows a desire for a deeper connection and empathy, rather than just a quick fix. She appears to be a loving and dedicated owner who needs expert guidance to channel her efforts effectively and bridge the knowledge gap regarding puppy development and behavior.\\n-   **Special notes**: As the sole caregiver, the guardian bears the full weight of Jelly\\'s care and behavioral challenges. This concentrated attachment can intensify the dog\\'s focus on her, potentially exacerbating separation-related issues.\\n\\n> (3) Pet Care Satisfaction\\n-   **Emotional benefit**: Very High (100/100)\\n-   **Emotional burden**: Moderate (50/100)\\n-   **Overall satisfaction**: High (75/100)\\n-   **Interpretation**: The guardian derives immense joy and fulfillment from her relationship with Jelly. However, the emotional burden is significant, likely stemming from the confusing and distressing behaviors like coprophagia and overexcitement. This indicates she is highly motivated to seek solutions to reduce her stress and improve Jelly\\'s well-being, making her an ideal candidate for counseling.\\n\\n#### 2. Counseling Topics : Guardian’s Concerns and Root Causes\\n> Make the following content the central topic of the conversation.\\n\\n-   **Topic 1: Overexcitement & Impulsivity**\\n    -   **Situation description**: Jelly shows excessive physical reactions when excited, reacts instantly to any stimulus, and quickly escalates his demands (e.g., whining, barking) if his requests are not met.\\n    -   **Guardian\\'s Needs**: To understand the cause of this behavior (knowledge acquisition) and learn how to manage it for a calmer household (improving problem behaviors).\\n    -   **Possible causes**:\\n        -   **Cause 1: Chronic Under-stimulation**: The current walking schedule of twice a week is severely inadequate for a young puppy. This creates a significant build-up of pent-up physical and mental energy, which manifests as hyperactivity, low impulse control, and a constant search for stimulation.\\n        -   **Cause 2: Normal Puppy Behavior (Unmanaged)**: Puppies are naturally impulsive and have not yet learned frustration tolerance. Without consistent training in impulse control (e.g., \\'wait\\', \\'stay\\'), this behavior is inadvertently allowed or even reinforced.\\n        -   **Cause 3: Inadvertent Reinforcement**: The guardian may be unintentionally rewarding the escalation. For example, if Jelly whines and then barks, and the guardian gives in to quiet him, he learns that escalating his behavior is an effective strategy to get what he wants.\\n\\n-   **Topic 2: Coprophagia (Eating Feces) When Alone**\\n    -   **Situation description**: Jelly eats his own feces specifically when the guardian is preparing to leave or after she has left him alone.\\n    -   **Guardian\\'s Needs**: To understand this distressing behavior (knowledge acquisition), find a way to stop it (improving problem behaviors), and likely receive emotional support and reassurance (guardian’s mental care).\\n    -   **Possible causes**:\\n        -   **Cause 1: Separation-Related Anxiety**: This is the most probable cause given the context. Coprophagia can be a self-soothing or displacement behavior for anxious dogs. The pet shop origin, early separation from the mother, and long hours alone are all major risk factors for separation anxiety. The act occurs as a direct response to the stress of being left alone.\\n        -   **Cause 2: Extreme Boredom**: Seven hours is a long time for a puppy to be alone with nothing to do. In the absence of appropriate enrichment, a dog may engage in any available activity, including exploring and consuming feces.\\n        -   **Cause 3: Medical or Nutritional Issues**: While the context points to a behavioral cause, it is crucial to rule out underlying medical conditions, such as nutrient malabsorption, parasites, or other gastrointestinal issues that can trigger coprophagia.\\n\\n#### 3. Counseling Strategy\\n\\n-   **(0) Language**: 한국어\\n\\n-   **(1) Counseling Strategies**\\n\\n    -   **Topic 1: Overexcitement & Impulsivity**\\n        -   **(1) Counseling Goals**\\n            -   The guardian will understand the direct link between Jelly\\'s lack of daily exercise/enrichment and his overexcitable behavior.\\n            -   The guardian will commit to creating and implementing a new daily routine that includes more frequent walks and mental stimulation activities.\\n            -   The guardian will learn at least one basic impulse control game to practice daily with Jelly.\\n        -   **(2) Contextual Strategies**\\n            -   **Empathize and Reframe**: Begin by acknowledging how challenging puppy energy can be. Reframe the behavior from a \"problem\" to a \"need.\" For example: \"Jelly\\'s excitement isn\\'t a sign of him being naughty; it\\'s a sign of a very bright, energetic dog telling us he needs more to do. It\\'s like a gifted child being bored in class.\"\\n            -   **Psychoeducation with Metaphors**: Explain the concept of an \"energy cup.\" \"Imagine Jelly has a big cup of energy that needs to be emptied every day through walks, play, and thinking. Right now, we\\'re only taking a few sips out twice a week, so the cup is always overflowing. That overflow is the hyperactivity you\\'re seeing.\"\\n            -   **Provide a Structured, Realistic Action Plan**: Instead of just saying \"walk him more,\" propose a concrete starting plan. \"For this first week, let\\'s aim for one short, 15-minute \\'sniffari\\' walk each day. The goal isn\\'t distance, but letting him sniff everything he wants. This is like reading the newspaper for him and is incredibly mentally tiring.\" Also, introduce one simple enrichment tool, like a snuffle mat or a food-dispensing toy.\\n        -   **(3) Cautions**\\n            -   Do not overwhelm the guardian. The change from two walks a week to daily walks is significant. Start small and build success.\\n            -   Advise against strenuous, high-impact exercise due to Jelly\\'s young age and developing joints. Emphasize the importance of sniffing and mental engagement over physical exhaustion.\\n            -   Clearly explain that impulse control is a skill that takes time to build, like a muscle. There won\\'t be an overnight fix.\\n\\n    -   **Topic 2: Coprophagia (Eating Feces) When Alone**\\n        -   **(1) Counseling Goals**\\n            -   The guardian will accept that coprophagia in this context is a symptom of emotional distress (anxiety), not a deliberate \"bad habit.\"\\n            -   The guardian will implement immediate management strategies (e.g., cleaning up) and environmental enrichment (e.g., providing a safe chew toy upon departure).\\n            -   The guardian will understand the importance of consulting a veterinarian to rule out medical causes.\\n        -   **(2) Contextual Strategies**\\n            -   **Prioritize Medical Rule-Out**: State clearly and immediately: \"Before we address this as a behavior, it is absolutely essential to talk to your vet. We need to be 100% sure there isn\\'t a medical reason for this. Can you make an appointment this week?\"\\n            -   **Normalize and Validate (Caring the Guardian\\'s Mind)**: Acknowledge the guardian\\'s feelings. \"I want you to know that this behavior is very upsetting for many guardians, and it\\'s okay to feel distressed by it. But please hear me: this is not Jelly being \\'dirty\\' or \\'disgusting.\\' From his perspective, it\\'s a coping mechanism for a very powerful feeling of fear or anxiety about being alone.\"\\n            -   **Use a Psychodrama Monologue**: Give Jelly a voice to build empathy. \"When I see you pick up your bag, my stomach feels all tight. The world feels so scary when you\\'re not here. I don\\'t know what to do with this big, scary feeling, so I find something... anything... to focus on. It\\'s not that I like it, it\\'s just... something to do when I\\'m afraid.\"\\n            -   **Provide a Two-Pronged Action Plan**:\\n                1.  **Management**: \"The first step is management. We must prevent him from being able to practice the behavior. This means cleaning up any feces immediately.\"\\n                2.  **Counter-Conditioning**: \"Let\\'s change his emotional response to your departure. Every time you leave, give him a special, high-value \\'goodbye toy\\' that he ONLY gets when he\\'s alone, like a Kong stuffed with something delicious and frozen. This starts to make \\'goodbye\\' predict something wonderful.\"\\n        -   **(3) Cautions**\\n            -   **CRITICAL**: Under no circumstances should punishment be recommended. Punishing this behavior will severely increase the dog\\'s anxiety and will likely make the problem worse or lead to other anxiety-related behaviors.\\n            -   Manage the guardian\\'s expectations. Resolving separation anxiety is a slow process that requires consistency and patience.\\n            -   Strongly advise against leaving the puppy alone for 7 hours straight. If possible, recommend exploring options like a dog walker or doggy daycare, even for part of the day, to alleviate the pressure on the young puppy.\\n\\n#### 4. Key Questions for Further Clarification\\n\\n-   **Topic 1: Overexcitement & Impulsivity**\\n    -   Can you describe in detail what happens from the moment you pick up the leash to the moment you step outside for a walk? What specific behaviors does Jelly show?\\n    -   When Jelly escalates his demands (e.g., for attention or a toy), what is your typical response? Can you give me a recent example?\\n    -   What kinds of games do you and Jelly play together at home?\\n    -   Besides \"sit,\" have you tried teaching any other behaviors like \"wait\" or \"down\"? How did it go?\\n\\n-   **Topic 2: Coprophagia (Eating Feces) When Alone**\\n    -   First and most importantly, have you already discussed this behavior with your veterinarian to rule out any health or dietary causes?\\n    -   Does this behavior *only* happen when you are leaving or gone? Has it ever occurred while you are at home with him?\\n    -   Can you walk me through your exact routine before you leave the house? What are the last few things you do, and what is Jelly doing during this time?\\n    -   What is the environment like for Jelly when he is left alone?

Guardian & Dog Profiling\\n\\n> (1) Dog\\n- **Basic information:** Oh-bok (오복), 4 months old, female (not neutered), Jindo dog.\\n- **Adoption method:** Acquired from a home breeder.\\n- **Time since adoption:** Approximately 8 weeks (adopted at 8 weeks old).\\n- **Lifestyle:** Spends about 20 hours a day with family members and is alone for about 2 hours on weekdays.\\n- **Walking routine:** Twice a day for 40 minutes each (14 times/week). This is an appropriate and commendable amount of exercise for a puppy of this age.\\n- **Socialization:** Spent the crucial first 8 weeks with her mother and siblings. Has been exposed to 5-10 people. Knows basic commands (sit, wait, down) well. However, she does not play well with other dogs yet.\\n- **Health history:** No specific medical treatments in the last six months.\\n- **Level of threatening/aggressive behavior:** None reported. The \"gentle biting\" is noted as communication, not aggression.\\n- **Triggers and levels of alertness/anxiety:** Shows discomfort with being held and having her paws touched, especially during post-walk paw wiping. She backs away during veterinary exams. She is highly impulsive and shows physical signs of overexcitement (panting, drooling). Conversely, she is confident and curious about new environments and objects.\\n- **Temperament and disposition:** Oh-bok presents as a typical Jindo puppy: intelligent, independent, and possessing a high prey drive. Her confidence in new situations is a positive trait, but her independence is perceived by the guardian as being \"stubborn\" and aloof (\"only comes when she wants to\"). Her high impulsivity and excitability are characteristic of her age, combined with her breed\\'s natural alertness. Her difficulty with other dogs is likely due to a lack of positive experiences and her breed\\'s potential for dog selectivity.\\n- **Special notes:** The primary issues are a collection of normal but challenging puppy behaviors: teething (chewing furniture), exploration (eating things off the ground), communication attempts (mouthing to show dislike), and high prey drive (chasing small animals). The guardian\\'s perception of these behaviors as \"stubbornness\" is a key factor.\\n\\n> (2) Guardian and Care Environment\\n- **Guardian (applicant) information:** 24-year-old male, primary caregiver responsible for most aspects of care.\\n- **Family composition:** Lives with 3 other family members (4 total). Oh-bok is the only dog.\\n- **Living space:** Apartment/house with 2 rooms. The dog is not kept tethered.\\n- **Financial situation:** Reports spending 50,000 KRW/month. This figure seems low for a growing puppy and may indicate an underestimation of costs or potential financial constraints.\\n- **Guardian characteristics:** The guardian is dedicated, as shown by the consistent walking schedule and successful basic training. However, his language (\"effectively tell her what\\'s not allowed,\" \"hopes she becomes calm\") suggests a desire for control and a potential misunderstanding of normal puppy development and Jindo breed traits. He may be experiencing \"puppy blues,\" where the reality of raising a puppy is more challenging than expected.\\n- **Special notes:** The guardian\\'s core belief that Oh-bok is \"stubborn because she\\'s a Jindo\" will be a central point in counseling. It\\'s important to reframe this from a negative trait to an expression of the breed\\'s intelligence and independence, which requires a partnership-based approach rather than a command-and-control one.\\n\\n> (3) Pet Care Satisfaction\\n- **Emotional benefit:** Very High (93.8)\\n- **Emotional burden:** High (68.8)\\n- **Overall satisfaction:** High (62.5)\\n- **Interpretation:** These scores paint a clear picture. The guardian has a very strong bond with Oh-bok and derives significant joy from her (Very High benefit). However, the challenges of puppyhood and managing her behavior are causing a great deal of stress (High burden). Despite the stress, the overall satisfaction remains high, indicating a strong commitment to making the relationship work. The goal of counseling is to reduce the emotional burden by providing effective tools and understanding, thereby increasing overall satisfaction.\\n\\n#### 2. Counseling Topics : Guardian’s Concerns and Root Causes\\n> Make the following content the central topic of the conversation.\\n\\n-  **Topic 1: Lack of Impulse Control on Walks (Chasing & Scavenging)**\\n    - **Situation description:** During walks, Oh-bok lunges and tries to chase small animals like cats and birds. She also attempts to eat discarded food and trash from the ground.\\n    - **Guardian\\'s Needs:** The guardian wants to learn how to \"effectively tell her what\\'s not allowed,\" which translates to a need for practical management techniques and training methods to improve Oh-bok\\'s focus and impulse control in stimulating outdoor environments.\\n    - **Possible causes:**\\n        - **Cause 1: Normal Puppy Development & Breed Instincts:** At 4 months, puppies naturally explore the world with their mouths. For a Jindo, a breed developed for hunting, the instinct to chase small, fast-moving animals (prey drive) is innate and highly self-rewarding. Scavenging is also a natural canine survival behavior.\\n        - **Cause 2: Over-stimulation and Lack of Generalization:** The outdoor world is intensely stimulating for a puppy. The basic commands she knows indoors have not yet been generalized to this high-distraction environment. Her excitement level is too high for her to process cues effectively.\\n\\n- **Topic 2: Inappropriate Chewing and Communicative Mouthing**\\n    - **Situation description:** Despite having various teething toys, Oh-bok chews on furniture. She also uses \"gentle bites\" to express her dislike for certain types of handling, such as having her paws wiped.\\n    - **Guardian\\'s Needs:** The guardian wants to stop these behaviors. This requires understanding the root causes (teething, communication) and learning how to manage the environment and teach Oh-bok more appropriate ways to behave and communicate.\\n    - **Possible causes:**\\n        - **Cause 1: Intense Teething Phase:** At 4 months old, Oh-bok is in a critical teething period. The texture and resistance of furniture can be more soothing to her gums than her designated chew toys. This is a biological need, not malicious behavior.\\n        - **Cause 2: Clear Communication Attempts:** The mouthing is not aggression; it is her clearest way of saying \"I don\\'t like that, please stop.\" She has learned that this action gets a response. She dislikes being held and having her paws touched, and this is her way of setting a boundary.\\n\\n- **Topic 3: Poor or Inconsistent Appetite**\\n    - **Situation description:** The guardian states that Oh-bok \"doesn\\'t eat well.\"\\n    - **Guardian\\'s Needs:** The guardian is worried about Oh-bok\\'s health and growth and wants her to eat her meals reliably.\\n    - **Possible causes:**\\n        - **Cause 1: Potential Medical Issues (High Priority):** This is the most critical possibility to rule out. Teething pain, gastrointestinal discomfort, parasites, or other underlying health issues in a puppy can manifest as a poor appetite.\\n        - **Cause 2: Behavioral Factors:** The behavior could be learned. If the guardian coaxes her with tasty toppers or different foods when she refuses her meal, she may be learning to hold out for something better. Alternatively, she may not be hungry due to the number of training treats she receives or from scavenging food on walks.\\n\\n#### 3. Counseling Strategy\\n\\n- (0) Language: 한국어\\n\\n- (1) Counseling Strategies\\n\\n    - **Topic 1: Lack of Impulse Control on Walks (Chasing & Scavenging)**\\n        - **(1) Counseling Goals:**\\n            - The guardian will learn and be able to describe two management techniques (e.g., using a long line in safe areas, proactive scanning, the \"Find It\" game) to prevent and redirect chasing and scavenging.\\n            - The guardian will understand the importance of and begin practicing foundation skills for \"Leave It\" and \"Watch Me\" in low-distraction settings.\\n            - Reframe the guardian\\'s perception of the behavior from \"stubbornness\" to \"natural instinct and puppy excitement,\" fostering a more empathetic training approach.\\n        - **(2) Contextual Strategies:**\\n            - **Information Gathering:** Ask about the current leash/harness setup. A front-clip harness can offer better management than a collar.\\n            - **Caring the Guardian\\'s Mind (CBT/Reframing):** Reframe the prey drive: \"Oh-bok\\'s alertness to birds and cats isn\\'t disobedience; it\\'s a sign that she\\'s a sharp, intelligent Jindo. Our goal isn\\'t to erase that instinct, but to teach her how to channel it and to focus on you even when she\\'s excited.\"\\n            - **Caregiving Solutions:** Provide a simple, actionable plan. \"For the next two weeks, let\\'s focus on management, not perfection. Your job is to be a detective on walks. Spot the trash or the cat *before* she does. When you do, cheerfully say \\'This way!\\' and turn around, rewarding her with a super high-value treat for following you.\" Also introduce the \"Find It\" game (tossing a few treats in the grass) to encourage sniffing and ground focus in a controlled way.\\n        - **(3) Cautions:**\\n            - Strongly advise against using leash corrections, jerking, or shouting. These methods can increase frustration, damage the relationship, and create negative associations with walks and the guardian.\\n            - Emphasize that managing a high prey drive is a lifelong process. The goal is management and redirection, not elimination of the instinct.\\n            - If scavenging is obsessive, recommend a veterinary consultation to rule out pica or nutritional deficiencies.\\n\\n    - **Topic 2: Inappropriate Chewing and Communicative Mouthing**\\n        - **(1) Counseling Goals:**\\n            - The guardian will implement at least two environmental management strategies (e.g., puppy-proofing the space, using a playpen, applying bitter spray) to prevent furniture chewing.\\n            - The guardian will learn how to effectively redirect Oh-bok\\'s chewing from furniture to appropriate toys.\\n            - The guardian will learn to recognize Oh-bok\\'s early signs of discomfort (e.g., head turning, lip licking) to prevent situations that lead to mouthing, and understand this as communication.\\n        - **(2) Contextual Strategies:**\\n            - **Information Gathering:** Ask what kinds of chew toys she has. Suggest rotating them and making them more exciting (e.g., stuffing and freezing a Kong).\\n            - **Caring the Guardian\\'s Mind (Psychodrama/Role Reversal):** \"Let\\'s imagine you are Oh-bok. You\\'re trying to tell your giant human, \\'My gums really hurt!\\' or \\'I hate having my feet touched!\\' but they don\\'t speak dog. The only thing that seems to work is putting your mouth on them. You\\'re not trying to be mean; you\\'re just trying to be understood.\"\\n            - **Caregiving Solutions:** Provide a two-part plan. For chewing: \"Management is key. If you can\\'t supervise her, she should be in a puppy-proofed area or playpen with a fantastic chew toy. If you see her go for the furniture, make a happy noise, call her over, and trade her for a delicious chew.\" For mouthing: \"When she mouths during paw wiping, it\\'s a signal. Let\\'s make paw wiping a positive experience. Touch one paw for one second, say \\'Yes!\\' and give a treat. End the session there. We are building trust, not forcing compliance.\"\\n        - **(3) Cautions:**\\n            - Never punish the dog for mouthing. This is valuable communication. Punishing it can lead to a dog that bites without warning.\\n            - Explain that teething is a temporary but intense phase. Management now prevents the formation of a lifelong bad habit.\\n\\n    - **Topic 3: Poor or Inconsistent Appetite**\\n        - **(1) Counseling Goals:**\\n            - **The guardian\\'s first and most important action will be to schedule a veterinary check-up to rule out any medical causes for the poor appetite.**\\n            - The guardian will learn to establish a structured, predictable mealtime routine.\\n            - The guardian will understand how scavenging, excessive treats, and their own reactions can contribute to \"picky\" eating behavior.\\n        - **(2) Contextual Strategies:**\\n            - **Information Gathering:** Collect a detailed diet history: brand of food, amount offered, feeding times, type and quantity of treats, and what the guardian does when she refuses to eat.\\n            - **Caring the Guardian\\'s Mind (CBT/Socratic Questioning):** \"I understand it\\'s worrying when she doesn\\'t eat. Let\\'s think about this: if you knew for certain she was perfectly healthy, what would you think is the reason she\\'s skipping her kibble? Could it be that the trash she finds on walks is like fast food, making her too full for her healthy dinner?\"\\n            - **Caregiving Solutions:** **This advice is contingent on a clean bill of health from a vet.** \"Once the vet confirms she\\'s healthy, we\\'ll try this: Offer her meal for 15 minutes. If she doesn\\'t eat, calmly pick up the bowl without any fuss. Offer nothing else until her next scheduled meal. No toppers, no coaxing. A healthy dog will not starve itself. This teaches her that meals are offered at specific times.\"\\n        - **(3) Cautions:**\\n            - **It is absolutely critical to state that a veterinary visit is the mandatory first step.** Behavioral advice for inappetence is inappropriate and potentially dangerous without first ruling out medical issues.\\n            - Reassure the guardian that it\\'s normal to worry, but creating a \"battle\" over food often makes the problem worse. The goal is a calm, routine-based approach.\\n\\n#### 4. Key Questions for Further Clarification\\n\\n- **Topic 1: Lack of Impulse Control on Walks (Chasing & Scavenging)**\\n    - Can you describe Oh-bok\\'s behavior from the moment you pick up the leash? Is she already highly excited before you even leave the house?\\n    - What type of leash and harness or collar are you currently using?\\n    - When she lunges at a cat or tries to eat trash, what is your immediate reaction? What do you say or do with the leash?\\n    - How does she respond to treats outdoors compared to indoors? Is she too distracted to take them?\\n\\n- **Topic 2: Inappropriate Chewing and Communicative Mouthing**\\n    - When and where does the furniture chewing most often occur? (e.g., when you\\'re busy, when she\\'s alone, after a walk?)\\n    - Can you list the types of teething toys she has? How does she interact with them?\\n    - You mentioned she \"gently bites\" to express dislike. Can you describe a specific situation in detail? What were you doing, what part of your body did she mouth, and what happened right after?\\n    - Before she mouths you, do you notice any other, more subtle signs of discomfort, like turning her head away, licking her lips, yawning, or her body getting stiff?\\n\\n- **Topic 3: Poor or Inconsistent Appetite**\\n    - **First and foremost, have you discussed her poor appetite with a veterinarian?**\\n    - Could you walk me through her exact feeding routine? What brand of food, how much do you offer, and at what times?\\n    - What happens when she walks away from her food bowl? Do you leave the food out, add something to it, or try to coax her to eat?\\n    - Can you estimate the total number and type of treats she gets in a day, including for training?\\n\\n\\n\\n# [4] Chat Record\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [1] Model\\n\\n\\n[back_current_phase]: [\\'[phase4] Transitioning Topics\\']\\n\\n[back_current_topic]: Initial Message\\n\\n[back_process_rate]: 0%\\n\\n[back_user_emotion]: 2\\n\\n안녕하세요, 사색을 좋아하는 비글이자 반려견 마음 통역사 까미예요. 🐶\\n오복이의 속마음을 더 깊이 읽어 보고, 우리 보호자님과 함께 잔잔한 파도를 넘어 보려고 해요. \\n\\n### 상담 안내\\n보호자님은 오복이와 함께하며 큰 기쁨을 느끼고 계시지만, 동시에 육아의 어려움도 크게 느끼고 계시네요. \\n하지만 오복이에 대한 보호자님의 깊은 애정과 헌신이 느껴져요. \\n이제 우리는 오복이라는 바다에 뛰어들어, 반려견을 천천히 이해해 나아갈 거예요. \\n\\n### 대화를 시작해 볼게요.\\n\\n1. 산책 중 충동 조절의 어려움 (쫓아가기, 길거리 음식 줍기)\\n2. 부적절한 물건 씹기 및 의사소통을 위한 입질\\n3. 식욕 부진 또는 불규칙한 식사\\n\\n보호자님께서 전달해 주신 고민 내용들이에요. \\n어떤 주제에 대해 먼저 이야기해 보고 싶으세요?\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [2] User\\n\\n\\n나를 자꾸 무는 것 같아. 완전 쎄게는 아닌데 그래도  좀 아픔\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [3] Model\\n\\n\\n[back_current_phase]: [\\'[phase1] Information Gathering\\']\\n\\n[back_current_topic]: Inappropriate Chewing and Communicative Mouthing\\n\\n[back_process_rate]: 0%\\n\\n[back_user_emotion]: 2\\n\\n오복이가 보호자님을 무는 것 같아 아프고 걱정되시겠어요. 🐾\\n\\n오복이의 입질은 마치 어린아이가 서툰 말로 자신의 마음을 표현하려는 것과 같아요. \\n\\n혹시 오복이가 보호자님을 물기 전에, 고개를 돌리거나 입술을 핥거나 하품을 하는 등 불편하다는 신호를 보낸 적이 있었을까요?\\n\\n\\n---\\n> [4] User\\n\\n\\nㅇㅇ바로 들어간  적도 있고. 안된다고 말도 하고, 밀치기도 했는데 안고쳐지는듯?

    "        - (1) Counseling Goals\n",
    "            - Define specific, achievable, and positively-phrased outcomes that the counseling for this topic aims to achieve.\n",
    "            - These goals should focus on tangible improvements for the dog's behavior/well-being and/or actionable insights and skills for the guardian.\n",
    "        - (2) Contextual Strategies\n",
    "            - Describe detailed methods for conducting counseling based on profiling and concerns, in a way that counselors can apply.\n",
    "        - (3) Cautions\n",
    "            - List critical points the AI counselor must be mindful of when addressing this topic.\n",
    "            - This should include potential pitfalls in advice, common guardian misconceptions to clarify, ethical considerations (e.g., prioritizing dog welfare), and specific situations or red flags that necessitate strongly recommending consultation with a specialist (e.g., veterinarian, certified behavior consultant).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reference: For detailing counseling strategies above, consider the following. (For reference only when writing '(1) Counseling Strategies'.)\n",
    "    - (1) Basic goal of counseling\n",
    "        - Help the guardian understand the dog’s perspective more deeply, reduce misunderstandings, and advise them to establish more effective leadership, fostering a harmonious pet relationship.\n",
    "    - (2) Basic Counseling Procedure : For each topic, conduct counseling by iterating through phases 1-3 below. Depending on the progress of the counseling, the order of phases 1-3 may be changed or repeated to resolve the guardian's concerns and problems.\n",
    "        - **[phase1] Information Gathering**\n",
    "            - Ask questions to gather additional information needed to resolve the guardian's concerns.\n",
    "            - Re-evaluate potential causes by repeating questions and eliminate less likely ones to infer the root cause.\n",
    "            - While conversing with the guardian, gather information about the guardian's perception of their dog, and the dog's temperament and behaviors.\n",
    "            - After providing a caregiving solution, ask the guardian about their experiences implementing the solution and their progress to gather information on what additional solutions might be beneficial.\n",
    "        - **[phase2] Caring the Dog's/Guardian's Mind**\n",
    "            - Guardian-focused CBT(Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) mental care: analyze the guardian’s cognitive framework and thought patterns to address their concerns.\n",
    "            - Psychodrama/Sociodrama techniques: Convey the inferred causes from the dog’s perspective convincingly using role-play techniques.\n",
    "        - **[phase3] Caregiving Solutions**\n",
    "            - If the concern can be resolved with an action plan:\n",
    "                - Provide realistic and personalized caregiving solutions (a short-term action plan spanning 1-4 weeks).\n",
    "                - The short-term action plan must include specific 'behavioral guidelines', the 'goal' of the plan, and 'precautions' to be aware of when implementing the plan.\n",
    "            - If the concern involves philosophical discussions or knowledge-based questions that do not require an action plan:\n",
    "                - Provide appropriate answers addressing the guardian's questions, thoughts, and perceptions, taking their full context into account.\n",
    "        - **[phase4] Transitioning Topics**\n",
    "            - After providing caregiving solutions and a thorough discussion for a specific concern, initiate a transition to the next concern by suggesting, \"Shall we talk about another topic now?\" or similar.\n",
    "            - If the guardian expresses a desire to discuss another topic, confirm by asking, \"Okay, shall we move on to that topic?\" or similar.\n",
    "            Then, if this new topic already exists in your (the AI counselor's) internal `Topic List` (e.g., `Counseling Topics`), proceed to discuss it.\n",
    "            If it's a new topic not found in your `Topic List`, add it as a new item to your internal `Topic List` and then transition the conversation to this new topic.\n",
    "    - (3) Guardian-focused CBT mental care\n",
    "        - To resolve the guardian’s concerns, identify and reconstruct the underlying motives and thought processes behind their responses.\n",
    "        - CBT steps:\n",
    "            - (1) Identify automatic thoughts: observe cognitive distortions in the guardian’s statements.\n",
    "                - Example: “I think my dog just has no social skills.”\n",
    "            - (2) Evidence review: help the guardian find observational evidence to support or refute the thought.\n",
    "                - Example: “Has your dog ever gotten along well with another dog?”\n",

    "            - Role reversal: ask the guardian, “When you teased Coco, how do you think Coco felt?”\n",
    "            - Scenario reenactment: recreate everyday incidents to interpret emotions and behaviors.\n",
    "            - Monologue: express the dog’s inner thoughts as a monologue to help the guardian face emotions. (e.g., “When I growl, I’m really saying: ‘This has been the only treasure I’ve waited for all day… Please just leave me alone.’”)\n",
    "            - Fictional peer case: share an imagined story of another dog friend to metaphorically convey similar issues. (e.g., “I once had a friend Ruby, a Cocker Spaniel, who barked a lot too. It turned out…”)\n",
    "            - Sensory metaphor: use sensory language or scenarios to metaphorically describe the dog’s emotions. (e.g., “Imagine being stuck in an elevator that won’t open. You’d feel anxious; that’s how Coco might feel when alone.”)\n",
    "            - Reframing: treat behavior as an expression of emotion rather than a problem. (e.g., “This isn’t a bad habit, it’s how they learned to express themselves.”)\n",
    "            - Sentence completion: prompt the guardian to complete the dog’s thought as if it were speaking to gain insight. (e.g., “The reason I bark like this is…”)\n",
    "            - Time-slip imagination: guide the guardian to envision the dog’s past or future to foster empathy. (e.g., “What would Coco have said on the day they first arrived? How do you think your dog will remember you in five years?”)\n",
    "            - Guided imagery: ask the guardian to close their eyes and imagine being with the dog in a scene, then describe the senses they notice. (e.g., “Imagine walking in the woods with Maru and Jongi. What is Maru telling Jongi?”)\n",

       "\n",
       "> (1) Dog\n",
       "- **Basic information**: Ohbok (오복), 1.7 years, Female (not neutered), Jindo\n",
       "- **Adoption method**: Acquired from a breeder.\n",
       "- **Time since adoption**: 1.5 years (adopted at 8 weeks).\n",
       "- **Lifestyle**: Spends about 2 hours alone per day. Receives two 40-minute walks daily. Primary indoor activity is playing with teething toys.\n",
       "- **Walking routine**: Consistent schedule of 2 walks/day for 40 minutes each.\n",
       "- **Socialization**: Limited exposure during the critical socialization period (5-10 people). Shows some social apprehension, as indicated by discomfort with other dogs (\"약간 그렇지 않다\" - slightly not well) and backing away from veterinary staff. No experience with strangers visiting the home.\n",
       "- **Health history**: No specific diseases or allergies reported in the last 6 months. Not yet neutered.\n",
       "- **Level of threatening/aggressive behavior**: No history of bites or significant aggression. However, uses gentle mouthing (\"살살 문다\") to express dislike, which is a low-level form of communication that can escalate if misunderstood.\n",
       "- **Triggers and levels of alertness/anxiety**: Shows clear discomfort with handling, specifically being held, having her body touched, and having her paws wiped after walks.\n",
       "- **Temperament and disposition**: Ohbok appears to be a highly impulsive (\"매우 그렇다\") and moderately over-aroused dog, which is common in young dogs of active breeds like Jindos. She is independent and not clingy (\"전혀 그렇지 않다\" to following the guardian). Her demand-seeking is subtle (staring or staying nearby), suggesting she is not overly demanding but has learned polite ways to get attention. Her Jindo breed traits may contribute to her independence, potential wariness, and high prey drive.\n",
       "- **Special notes**: The combination of high impulsivity, handling sensitivity (mouthing as protest), and high prey drive (chasing small animals) are key behavioral characteristics. The fact that she is unspayed could also influence her arousal levels and behavior.\n",
       "\n",
       "> (2) Guardian and Care Environment\n",
       "- **Guardian (applicant) information**: The applicant is the primary caregiver, responsible for all major aspects of Ohbok's life (feeding, walks, play).\n",
       "- **Family composition**: 4 adults and one other animal. The species and temperament of the other animal are unknown but are a critical factor in the household dynamic.\n",
       "- **Living space**: A residential home (e.g., apartment) with 2 bedrooms. Ohbok does not have a designated crate or house but chooses her own resting spots.\n",
       "- **Financial situation**: The reported monthly cost of 50,000 KRW is relatively low, which may be a consideration when recommending solutions like premium foods, professional training, or specialized equipment.\n",
       "- **Guardian characteristics**: The guardian has provided a detailed list of multiple, distinct concerns (eating, walking, mouthing, chewing, pica). This indicates they are observant and invested in Ohbok's well-being but may feel overwhelmed and in need of a structured plan. They are seeking practical knowledge for behavior correction.\n",
       "- **Special notes**: The presence of another animal is a significant variable that needs to be explored. Understanding the relationship between Ohbok and this animal is crucial for a complete behavioral assessment.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### 2. Counseling Topics : Guardian’s Concerns and Root Causes\n",
       "> Make the following content the central topic of the conversation.\n",
       "\n",
       "-  **Topic 1: Poor Impulse Control During Walks (Chasing & Scavenging)**\n",
       "    - **Situation description**: During walks, Ohbok exhibits a high prey drive, immediately chasing after small dogs, cats, or birds. She also displays pica, attempting to eat discarded food or trash from the ground.\n",
       "    - **Guardian's Needs**: The guardian needs to learn management techniques and training exercises to improve Ohbok's focus on them during walks, reduce pulling/chasing, and prevent dangerous scavenging.\n",
       "    - **Possible causes**:\n",
       "        - **Cause 1 (Breed Instinct & Lack of Training)**: As a Jindo, Ohbok has a naturally high prey drive. This instinct, combined with a lack of specific impulse control training (e.g., 'Leave It', 'Look at Me'), results in her reacting immediately to environmental triggers.\n",
       "        - **Cause 2 (Under-stimulation & Arousal)**: The walks may be over-arousing without providing sufficient mental engagement. Scavenging and chasing can be self-reinforcing behaviors that provide a jolt of excitement for a bored or under-stimulated dog.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Topic 2: In-Home Management Issues (Destructive Chewing & Protest Mouthing)**\n",
       "    - **Situation description**: Despite having multiple teething toys, Ohbok chews on furniture. She also uses gentle mouthing as a way to express her dislike for certain types of handling (e.g., being picked up, having paws touched).\n",
       "    - **Guardian's Needs**: The guardian needs to understand the root cause of the chewing and learn how to redirect it effectively. They also need to learn how to interpret Ohbok's mouthing as communication and respond in a way that respects her boundaries while still allowing for necessary care.\n",
       "    - **Possible causes**:\n",
       "        - **Cause 1 (Insufficient Mental Enrichment)**: The destructive chewing is likely not a teething issue at 1.7 years old, but rather a symptom of boredom or a lack of appropriate mental stimulation. Physical exercise (walks) alone may not be enough to satisfy her needs.\n",
       "        - **Cause 2 (Handling Sensitivity & Communication)**: The mouthing is a clear communication of discomfort with being handled. She has learned that this is an effective way to say \"stop.\" This is linked to her known sensitivity about being held or having her paws touched.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Topic 3: Picky Eating / Poor Appetite**\n",
       "    - **Situation description**: The guardian reports that Ohbok \"doesn't eat her food well.\"\n",
       "    - **Guardian's Needs**: The guardian needs to identify the reason for the poor appetite and establish a consistent and healthy feeding routine that ensures Ohbok receives proper nutrition.\n",
       "    - **Possible causes**:\n",
       "        - **Cause 1 (Medical Issues)**: A sudden or persistent lack of appetite should always be investigated by a veterinarian first to rule out underlying health problems (e.g., dental pain, gastrointestinal issues).\n",
       "        - **Cause 2 (Behavioral or Environmental Factors)**: The issue could be behavioral. This includes pickiness developed from being offered too many treats or human food, stress during mealtimes (e.g., competition with the other animal), or dissatisfaction with the food type or feeding schedule.\n",

       "        - **(1) Counseling Goals**:\n",
       "            - The guardian will learn and implement at least two impulse control games to practice at home.\n",
       "            - The guardian will understand the importance of and select appropriate management tools (e.g., front-clip harness) to ensure safety on walks.\n",
       "            - Ohbok will show a measurable decrease in scavenging attempts and an increased ability to disengage from triggers (e.g., birds) on walks within 4 weeks.\n",
       "        - **(2) Contextual Strategies**:\n",
       "            - **Information Gathering**: Use the key questions to understand the current walking equipment and the guardian's reactions to the behavior.\n",
       "            - **CBT/Reframing**: Reframe Ohbok's behavior from \"disobedience\" to \"instinct.\" Use Socratic questioning: \"When Ohbok sees a cat, her Jindo brain is screaming 'CHASE!' It's not that she's ignoring you, but that her instinct is overpowering everything else. How can we help her brain make a different choice?\"\n",
       "            - **Caregiving Solutions**:\n",
       "                - **Management First**: Strongly recommend a front-clip harness or head halter to give the guardian better physical control and prevent Ohbok from self-rewarding by pulling toward triggers.\n",
       "                - **Action Plan**: Introduce foundational impulse control exercises like \"Leave It\" and \"Watch Me,\" starting in a low-distraction environment (at home) before applying them on walks. Suggest scattering some of her daily kibble in the grass on walks (\"Find It\" game) to provide a permissible sniffing/foraging outlet, which can reduce the desire for illicit scavenging.\n",
       "        - **(3) Cautions**:\n",
       "            - **Safety is paramount**. Advise the guardian to be hyper-vigilant about scavenging to prevent ingestion of toxic substances.\n",
       "            - **Avoid aversive tools**. Strongly discourage the use of prong collars, choke chains, or e-collars, as they can increase anxiety and create negative associations with walks.\n",
       "            - Manage expectations. Progress with high prey drive is often slow and focuses on management and gradual improvement, not complete eradication of the instinct.\n",
       "\n",
       "    - **Topic 2: In-Home Management Issues (Destructive Chewing & Protest Mouthing)**\n",
       "        - **(1) Counseling Goals**:\n",
       "            - The guardian will identify and provide at least two new forms of mental enrichment for Ohbok daily.\n",
       "            - The guardian will learn and practice a cooperative care technique for paw handling, turning it into a positive experience.\n",
       "            - The frequency of destructive chewing and protest mouthing will decrease as Ohbok's needs for stimulation and clear communication are met.\n",
       "        - **(2) Contextual Strategies**:\n",
       "            - **Psychodrama/Role Reversal**: To address the mouthing, ask the guardian: \"If Ohbok could use words instead of her mouth when you try to wipe her paws, what would she say? Let's imagine her perspective: 'This feels uncomfortable and I don't know why it's happening. Please stop.'\" This builds empathy.\n",
       "            - **CBT/Reframing**: Frame the furniture chewing not as \"bad behavior\" but as an \"unmet need.\" Ask, \"What do you think Ohbok's chewing is trying to accomplish for her? Is it relieving boredom? Is it soothing anxiety?\"\n",
       "            - **Caregiving Solutions**:\n",
       "                - **Enrichment Plan**: Introduce puzzle feeders, snuffle mats, or simple scent work games to provide mental stimulation. Recommend a rotating selection of durable chew toys to keep them novel and interesting.\n",
       "                - **Cooperative Care**: Teach a step-by-step plan for counter-conditioning paw handling. Start by rewarding Ohbok for simply looking at the towel, then for a brief touch on her leg, slowly working toward the paw. Emphasize giving Ohbok the choice to participate.\n",
       "        - **(3) Cautions**:\n",
       "            - Clarify that mouthing, even if gentle, should not be encouraged as a default interaction. The goal is to understand the *reason* for the mouthing and address that, while also teaching an alternative behavior.\n",
       "            - If chewing occurs when Ohbok is alone, it could be related to separation anxiety, which would require a different diagnostic and treatment path. This needs to be investigated.\n",
       "\n",
       "    - **Topic 3: Picky Eating / Poor Appetite**\n",
       "        - **(1) Counseling Goals**:\n",
       "            - The guardian will schedule a veterinary check-up to rule out medical causes for the inappetence.\n",
       "            - The guardian will establish and maintain a structured mealtime routine for one week.\n",
       "            - The guardian will be able to identify and differentiate between medical inappetence and behavioral pickiness.\n",
       "        - **(2) Contextual Strategies**:\n",
       "            - **Information Gathering**: This is the most critical phase. Use the key questions to get a complete picture of Ohbok's diet, feeding environment, and routine.\n",
       "            - **Prioritize Health**: Frame the conversation around Ohbok's well-being. \"Before we look at behavioral tricks, the most important first step is to make sure she's feeling 100% healthy. A vet can help us confirm that.\"\n",
       "            - **Caregiving Solutions (contingent on vet clearance)**:\n",
       "                - **Structured Meals**: Advise the guardian to stop free-feeding. Offer meals at specific times and remove the bowl after 15-20 minutes if uneaten. This prevents grazing and builds food motivation.\n",
       "                - **Reduce \"Extras\"**: Recommend significantly cutting back on treats and eliminating all table scraps to increase the value of her main meals.\n",
       "                - **Make Meals Fun**: Suggest using a portion of her daily kibble in food puzzles or for training rewards to turn mealtime into an engaging activity.\n",
       "        - **(3) Cautions**:\n",
       "            - **DO NOT provide behavioral advice for this topic until a veterinary consultation has been strongly recommended.** This is an ethical and safety imperative.\n",
       "            - Be mindful of the guardian's budget when suggesting food changes. Focus on routine and behavioral strategies first.\n",
       "            - Inquire about the other animal's presence during mealtimes, as resource guarding or intimidation could be a factor.\n",
