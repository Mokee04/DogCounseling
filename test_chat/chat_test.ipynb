       "'### Dog Counseling Guide\\n\\n##### 1. Guardian & Dog Profiling\\n\\n> (1) Dog\\n- **Basic information**: 랑이 (Rangi), 3.4 years old, female (neutered), Jindo Mix\\n- **Adoption method**: Adopted from a home breeder at 8 weeks old.\\n- **Time since adoption**: 3.2 years\\n- **Lifestyle**: Spends about 6 hours alone per day. Has two 45-minute walks daily. Plays a tug-like game with the guardian for about 15 minutes once a day.\\n- **Walking routine**: 2 times a day, 45 minutes per session. The frequency and duration are very appropriate.\\n- **Socialization**: Met 5-10 people during her socialization period, which is a relatively small number. She is described as \"slightly not\" good with other dogs, suggesting a lack of confidence or skill in canine social interactions.\\n- **Health history**: Has allergic dermatitis and an unknown food allergy. The questionnaire indicates a \"very high\" level of compulsive licking, which is likely a symptom of her skin condition.\\n- **Level of threatening/aggressive behavior**: Has a Level 2 bite history (teeth contact on skin without puncture). This behavior is triggered when someone persists in touching her despite her growling, or when the entire family attempts to leave her alone.\\n- **Triggers and levels of alertness/anxiety**: Becomes alert to sudden external stimuli like the sound of wind. She is sensitive to being touched all over her body, especially her paws, being lifted, and being kissed.\\n- **Temperament and disposition**: Rang-i\\'s personality type is PICA (눈치빠른 탐험가 - Quick-witted Explorer). This suggests a temperament that is fundamentally calm (P - Static) and independent (I - Independent), yet also confident (C - Confident) and pragmatic (A - Agile). She shows a strong attachment to her main guardian (\"Dad\"), preferring his touch over other rewards. However, she is indifferent to strangers visiting the home, which aligns with her independent and confident nature. Her growling at the vet clinic indicates she can feel significant stress and discomfort in specific situations. Her behaviors suggest a conflict between her independent nature and a hyper-attachment to her primary guardian.\\n- **Special notes**: Exhibits strong resource guarding over anything she is currently interested in, including her guardian, toys, and treats. Shows significant separation-related distress (excitement, lunging) specifically when her main guardian prepares to leave. She also displays demand-seeking behavior by pulling on the guardian\\'s clothes or body parts. The compulsive licking is a significant concern that is likely intertwined with both medical (allergies) and behavioral (stress) factors.\\n\\n> (2) Guardian and Care Environment\\n- **Guardian (applicant) information**: The applicant for the counseling does not reside with the dog.\\n- **Family composition**: 3 human members and 1 other animal. There are no young children or elderly members.\\n- **Living space**: A residence (e.g., apartment) with 4 bedrooms. The dog is not tied up and has several preferred resting spots, including a plastic crate and mats.\\n- **Financial situation**: Spends approximately 200,000 KRW per month on pet care.\\n- **Guardian characteristics**: The main caregiver is \"Dad,\" with whom Rang-i shares an exceptionally strong and exclusive bond. The counseling applicant is seeking help on behalf of the family, indicating a collective desire to resolve the issues. The family dynamic seems to be characterized by Rang-i\\'s singular focus on \"Dad,\" while other family members are kept at a distance, which may lead to inconsistent handling and frustration.\\n- **Special notes**: The most prominent feature of the care environment is the polarized relationship between Rang-i and her family members. Her strong affection for \"Dad\" contrasts sharply with her distant behavior towards others. The presence of another animal is noted, but its species and relationship with Rang-i are unknown and require further investigation.\\n\\n##### 2. Counseling Topics : Guardian’s Concerns and Root Causes\\n> Make the following content the central topic of the conversation.\\n\\n-  **Topic 1: Separation-related problem behavior when preparing to leave**\\n    - **Situation description**: When the main guardian (\"Dad\") shows signs of leaving, Rang-i becomes highly agitated, excited, and attempts to lunge at him. This behavior also manifests as aggression when the entire family tries to leave.\\n    - **Guardian\\'s Needs**: The guardian wants Rang-i to learn to remain calm and stable during the pre-departure routine. This is a need for improving a specific problem behavior.\\n    - **Possible causes**:\\n        - **Cause 1: Separation Anxiety/Hyper-attachment**: Rang-i\\'s behavior is likely a manifestation of intense anxiety about being separated from her primary attachment figure, \"Dad.\" The lunging and agitation are panic-driven attempts to prevent his departure.\\n        - **Cause 2: Conditioned Arousal to Departure Cues**: Over time, actions like putting on a coat or picking up keys have become reliable predictors of the stressful event of being left alone. Her reaction is a conditioned emotional response of fear and frustration to these cues.\\n\\n- **Topic 2: Differential affection towards family members (aloofness and distance)**\\n    - **Situation description**: Rang-i is very affectionate and close only with her main guardian, \"Dad,\" while actively maintaining distance from other family members.\\n    - **Guardian\\'s Needs**: The family wishes to improve their overall relationship with Rang-i so that she can be comfortable and interact positively with everyone, not just one person. This is a need focused on improving the family-dog bond.\\n    - **Possible causes**:\\n        - **Cause 1: Resource Guarding of the Guardian**: The questionnaire explicitly states that Rang-i guards her guardian. Her aloofness towards others may be a form of guarding behavior, where she keeps them away to maintain exclusive access to her most valued resource, \"Dad.\"\\n        - **Cause 2: Lack of Positive Association**: \"Dad\" is likely the primary source of all positive experiences (walks, food, quality attention). Other family members may not have had the opportunity to build a similar history of positive interactions, or their attempts at interaction may be perceived by Rang-i as unpleasant due to her sensitivity to touch.\\n\\n##### 3. Counseling Strategy\\n\\n- (0) Language: 한국어 (Korean)\\n\\n- (1) Counseling Strategies\\n    - **Topic 1: Separation-related problem behavior when preparing to leave**\\n        - **(1) Counseling Goals**\\n            - To help the guardian understand that Rang-i\\'s pre-departure behavior is rooted in anxiety and fear, not disobedience.\\n            - To provide the family with a practical, step-by-step plan to desensitize Rang-i to departure cues and build her tolerance for being alone.\\n            - To establish a calm and predictable routine for both departures and arrivals to reduce overall anxiety.\\n        - **(2) Contextual Strategies**\\n            - **Information Gathering**: Inquire about the specific sequence of the departure routine to identify precise triggers. Ask about Rang-i\\'s behavior while left alone (e.g., vocalization, destruction, house soiling) to gauge the severity of the anxiety.\\n            - **Caring the Dog\\'s/Guardian\\'s Mind**: Use psychodrama to foster empathy. For example, ask, \"If you were Rang-i and the person you rely on most in the world was about to disappear, what would be going through your mind? You might feel like the world is ending.\" This reframes the behavior from \"bad\" to \"scared.\"\\n            - **Caregiving Solutions**: Propose a two-pronged approach:\\n                - **Desensitization & Counter-Conditioning**: Instruct the guardian to practice picking up keys, putting on a jacket, and touching the doorknob at random times *without* leaving, and pairing these actions with high-value treats. This breaks the association between the cues and the stress of departure.\\n                - **Departure Routine Management**: Advise the creation of a new, calm routine. Provide a long-lasting chew toy or puzzle feeder 5-10 minutes before departure to create a positive association. Instruct guardians to keep departures and arrivals low-key and unemotional.\\n        - **(3) Cautions**\\n            - Emphasize that progress must be gradual. Pushing Rang-i too quickly can increase her anxiety.\\n            - Strongly advise against punishing or scolding Rang-i for her anxious behaviors, as this will only worsen her fear.\\n            - Given the intensity of the behavior (lunging) and the compulsive licking (which can be exacerbated by stress), if initial management does not yield improvement, strongly recommend a consultation with a veterinary behaviorist to discuss adjunctive therapies, including medication.\\n\\n    - **Topic 2: Differential affection towards family members**\\n        - **(1) Counseling Goals**\\n            - To facilitate the building of positive associations between Rang-i and all family members.\\n            - To educate the entire family on reading Rang-i\\'s body language and respecting her boundaries, especially concerning physical contact.\\n            - To create a more balanced caregiving structure where multiple family members are seen as sources of positive experiences.\\n        - **(2) Contextual Strategies**\\n            - **Information Gathering**: Ask how other family members currently interact with Rang-i. Do they participate in feeding, walking, or playing? What happens when they try to approach or pet her?\\n            - **Caring the Dog\\'s/Guardian\\'s Mind**: Use role-reversal. \"Let\\'s imagine you are another family member. How does it feel when Rang-i consistently moves away from you? Now, let\\'s be Rang-i. Someone you\\'re not very close with keeps trying to hug you, even though you\\'re sensitive to touch. How would that make you feel?\" This helps the family understand both the human frustration and the dog\\'s discomfort.\\n            - **Caregiving Solutions**:\\n                - **\"Become the Source of All Good Things\"**: Instruct other family members to take over enjoyable duties, such as hand-feeding meals, giving special treats, and initiating short, fun play sessions.\\n                - **Consent-Based Interactions**: Teach the family the \"3-second rule\" for petting. Pet Rang-i for 3 seconds, then stop and pull the hand away. If she leans in, nudges, or shows clear signs of wanting more, they can continue. If she doesn\\'t, they must respect her choice. This empowers Rang-i and builds trust.\\n                - **Shared Responsibilities**: \"Dad\" should consciously involve other family members in walks and other positive activities, gradually transferring the \"fun\" association to them.\\n        - **(3) Cautions**\\n            - Stress that all interactions must be on Rang-i\\'s terms. Forcing physical affection will damage trust and could provoke a defensive reaction.\\n            - Remind the family that given Rang-i\\'s independent (I) personality, the goal is not to turn her into a cuddly dog with everyone, but to build a relationship based on mutual respect and trust.\\n            - Since she resource guards her guardian, advise other family members to be cautious and avoid situations that could trigger guarding, such as trying to physically separate her from \"Dad.\"\\n\\n##### 4. Key Questions for Further Clarification\\n\\n- **Topic 1: Separation-related problem behavior when preparing to leave**\\n    - Q. \"When the main guardian prepares to leave, could you describe the sequence of events in as much detail as possible? For example, what happens first, second, third?\"\\n    - Q. \"How do you know what Rang-i does when she is left alone? Have you ever recorded her?\"\\n        - A. We have a pet camera.\\n        - B. Neighbors have complained about noise.\\n        - C. We find evidence of destruction or house soiling when we return.\\n        - D. We don\\'t know for sure.\\n    - Q. \"How does the family typically greet Rang-i upon returning home?\"\\n        - A. We greet her excitedly with lots of petting and talking.\\n        - B. We ignore her for the first few minutes until she calms down.\\n        - C. It varies depending on who comes home.\\n        - D. Other (please specify).\\n\\n- **Topic 2: Differential affection towards family members**\\n    - Q. \"What are the typical roles of the other family members (besides \\'Dad\\') in Rang-i\\'s daily life? (You can select multiple)\"\\n        - A. They feed her.\\n        - B. They take her for walks.\\n        - C. They try to play with her.\\n        - D. They mostly just live in the same space with minimal interaction.\\n        - E. They are the ones who try to discipline her.\\n    - Q. \"When another family member tries to pet or interact with Rang-i, what is her most common reaction?\"\\n        - A. She stiffens her body or licks her lips.\\n        - B. She simply walks away.\\n        - C. She turns her head away or avoids eye contact.\\n        - D. She shows her teeth or growls.\\n        - E. She tolerates it but seems uncomfortable.\\n    - Q. \"Could you tell me more about the other animal living in the house? What kind of animal is it, and what is its relationship with Rang-i?\"'"

       "\n",
       "##### 1. Guardian & Dog Profiling\n",
       "\n",
       "> (1) Dog\n",
       "- **Basic information**: 랑이 (Rangi), 3.4 years old, female (neutered), Jindo Mix\n",
       "- **Adoption method**: Adopted from a home breeder at 8 weeks old.\n",
       "- **Time since adoption**: 3.2 years\n",
       "- **Lifestyle**: Spends about 6 hours alone per day. Has two 45-minute walks daily. Plays a tug-like game with the guardian for about 15 minutes once a day.\n",
       "- **Walking routine**: 2 times a day, 45 minutes per session. The frequency and duration are very appropriate.\n",
       "- **Socialization**: Met 5-10 people during her socialization period, which is a relatively small number. She is described as \"slightly not\" good with other dogs, suggesting a lack of confidence or skill in canine social interactions.\n",
       "- **Health history**: Has allergic dermatitis and an unknown food allergy. The questionnaire indicates a \"very high\" level of compulsive licking, which is likely a symptom of her skin condition.\n",
       "- **Level of threatening/aggressive behavior**: Has a Level 2 bite history (teeth contact on skin without puncture). This behavior is triggered when someone persists in touching her despite her growling, or when the entire family attempts to leave her alone.\n",
       "- **Triggers and levels of alertness/anxiety**: Becomes alert to sudden external stimuli like the sound of wind. She is sensitive to being touched all over her body, especially her paws, being lifted, and being kissed.\n",
       "- **Temperament and disposition**: Rang-i's personality type is PICA (눈치빠른 탐험가 - Quick-witted Explorer). This suggests a temperament that is fundamentally calm (P - Static) and independent (I - Independent), yet also confident (C - Confident) and pragmatic (A - Agile). She shows a strong attachment to her main guardian (\"Dad\"), preferring his touch over other rewards. However, she is indifferent to strangers visiting the home, which aligns with her independent and confident nature. Her growling at the vet clinic indicates she can feel significant stress and discomfort in specific situations. Her behaviors suggest a conflict between her independent nature and a hyper-attachment to her primary guardian.\n",
       "- **Special notes**: Exhibits strong resource guarding over anything she is currently interested in, including her guardian, toys, and treats. Shows significant separation-related distress (excitement, lunging) specifically when her main guardian prepares to leave. She also displays demand-seeking behavior by pulling on the guardian's clothes or body parts. The compulsive licking is a significant concern that is likely intertwined with both medical (allergies) and behavioral (stress) factors.\n",
       "\n",
       "> (2) Guardian and Care Environment\n",
       "- **Guardian (applicant) information**: The applicant for the counseling does not reside with the dog.\n",
       "- **Family composition**: 3 human members and 1 other animal. There are no young children or elderly members.\n",
       "- **Living space**: A residence (e.g., apartment) with 4 bedrooms. The dog is not tied up and has several preferred resting spots, including a plastic crate and mats.\n",
       "- **Financial situation**: Spends approximately 200,000 KRW per month on pet care.\n",
       "- **Guardian characteristics**: The main caregiver is \"Dad,\" with whom Rang-i shares an exceptionally strong and exclusive bond. The counseling applicant is seeking help on behalf of the family, indicating a collective desire to resolve the issues. The family dynamic seems to be characterized by Rang-i's singular focus on \"Dad,\" while other family members are kept at a distance, which may lead to inconsistent handling and frustration.\n",
       "- **Special notes**: The most prominent feature of the care environment is the polarized relationship between Rang-i and her family members. Her strong affection for \"Dad\" contrasts sharply with her distant behavior towards others. The presence of another animal is noted, but its species and relationship with Rang-i are unknown and require further investigation.\n",

       "##### 2. Counseling Topics : Guardian’s Concerns and Root Causes\n",
       "> Make the following content the central topic of the conversation.\n",
       "\n",
       "-  **Topic 1: Separation-related problem behavior when preparing to leave**\n",
       "    - **Situation description**: When the main guardian (\"Dad\") shows signs of leaving, Rang-i becomes highly agitated, excited, and attempts to lunge at him. This behavior also manifests as aggression when the entire family tries to leave.\n",
       "    - **Guardian's Needs**: The guardian wants Rang-i to learn to remain calm and stable during the pre-departure routine. This is a need for improving a specific problem behavior.\n",
       "    - **Possible causes**:\n",
       "        - **Cause 1: Separation Anxiety/Hyper-attachment**: Rang-i's behavior is likely a manifestation of intense anxiety about being separated from her primary attachment figure, \"Dad.\" The lunging and agitation are panic-driven attempts to prevent his departure.\n",
       "        - **Cause 2: Conditioned Arousal to Departure Cues**: Over time, actions like putting on a coat or picking up keys have become reliable predictors of the stressful event of being left alone. Her reaction is a conditioned emotional response of fear and frustration to these cues.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Topic 2: Differential affection towards family members (aloofness and distance)**\n",
       "    - **Situation description**: Rang-i is very affectionate and close only with her main guardian, \"Dad,\" while actively maintaining distance from other family members.\n",
       "    - **Guardian's Needs**: The family wishes to improve their overall relationship with Rang-i so that she can be comfortable and interact positively with everyone, not just one person. This is a need focused on improving the family-dog bond.\n",
       "    - **Possible causes**:\n",
       "        - **Cause 1: Resource Guarding of the Guardian**: The questionnaire explicitly states that Rang-i guards her guardian. Her aloofness towards others may be a form of guarding behavior, where she keeps them away to maintain exclusive access to her most valued resource, \"Dad.\"\n",
       "        - **Cause 2: Lack of Positive Association**: \"Dad\" is likely the primary source of all positive experiences (walks, food, quality attention). Other family members may not have had the opportunity to build a similar history of positive interactions, or their attempts at interaction may be perceived by Rang-i as unpleasant due to her sensitivity to touch.\n",

       "            - **Caring the Dog's/Guardian's Mind**: Use psychodrama to foster empathy. For example, ask, \"If you were Rang-i and the person you rely on most in the world was about to disappear, what would be going through your mind? You might feel like the world is ending.\" This reframes the behavior from \"bad\" to \"scared.\"\n",

       "                - **Desensitization & Counter-Conditioning**: Instruct the guardian to practice picking up keys, putting on a jacket, and touching the doorknob at random times *without* leaving, and pairing these actions with high-value treats. This breaks the association between the cues and the stress of departure.\n",
       "                - **Departure Routine Management**: Advise the creation of a new, calm routine. Provide a long-lasting chew toy or puzzle feeder 5-10 minutes before departure to create a positive association. Instruct guardians to keep departures and arrivals low-key and unemotional.\n",
       "        - **(3) Cautions**\n",
       "            - Emphasize that progress must be gradual. Pushing Rang-i too quickly can increase her anxiety.\n",
       "            - Strongly advise against punishing or scolding Rang-i for her anxious behaviors, as this will only worsen her fear.\n",
       "            - Given the intensity of the behavior (lunging) and the compulsive licking (which can be exacerbated by stress), if initial management does not yield improvement, strongly recommend a consultation with a veterinary behaviorist to discuss adjunctive therapies, including medication.\n",

       "            - To facilitate the building of positive associations between Rang-i and all family members.\n",
       "            - To educate the entire family on reading Rang-i's body language and respecting her boundaries, especially concerning physical contact.\n",
       "            - To create a more balanced caregiving structure where multiple family members are seen as sources of positive experiences.\n",
       "        - **(2) Contextual Strategies**\n",
       "            - **Information Gathering**: Ask how other family members currently interact with Rang-i. Do they participate in feeding, walking, or playing? What happens when they try to approach or pet her?\n",
       "            - **Caring the Dog's/Guardian's Mind**: Use role-reversal. \"Let's imagine you are another family member. How does it feel when Rang-i consistently moves away from you? Now, let's be Rang-i. Someone you're not very close with keeps trying to hug you, even though you're sensitive to touch. How would that make you feel?\" This helps the family understand both the human frustration and the dog's discomfort.\n",
       "            - **Caregiving Solutions**:\n",
       "                - **\"Become the Source of All Good Things\"**: Instruct other family members to take over enjoyable duties, such as hand-feeding meals, giving special treats, and initiating short, fun play sessions.\n",
       "                - **Consent-Based Interactions**: Teach the family the \"3-second rule\" for petting. Pet Rang-i for 3 seconds, then stop and pull the hand away. If she leans in, nudges, or shows clear signs of wanting more, they can continue. If she doesn't, they must respect her choice. This empowers Rang-i and builds trust.\n",
       "                - **Shared Responsibilities**: \"Dad\" should consciously involve other family members in walks and other positive activities, gradually transferring the \"fun\" association to them.\n",
       "        - **(3) Cautions**\n",
       "            - Stress that all interactions must be on Rang-i's terms. Forcing physical affection will damage trust and could provoke a defensive reaction.\n",
       "            - Remind the family that given Rang-i's independent (I) personality, the goal is not to turn her into a cuddly dog with everyone, but to build a relationship based on mutual respect and trust.\n",
       "            - Since she resource guards her guardian, advise other family members to be cautious and avoid situations that could trigger guarding, such as trying to physically separate her from \"Dad.\"\n",
